china is the largest foreign holder of us treasury securities , a major trade partner for the us , europe , latin america , and australia , and a key facilitator of intra-asian trade , owing partly to the scale of its processing trade .

america ’ s perpetual war-making in the middle east shows the worst .
as a result , there are simply too many luxurious condominiums , magnificent government office buildings , and soaring skyscrapers .
but this does not mean that accountability will be lost .
that said , as china undergoes structural economic transition , the stabilization potential of macroeconomic policy is limited .
efforts to address these structural challenges are being frustrated not just by institutional barriers , but also by entrenched official corruption .
in that case , the country will continue to be the world ’ s primary economic engine , contributing about 30 % of global growth until at least 2020 .
policies to improve the environment are also high on the government ’ s agenda for the next five years .
the underlying structural changes that have occurred in china in recent years reinforce this optimism .

moreover , unlike the bank-funded initiatives of 3-4 years ago , which led to a worrisome overhang of local-government debt , the central government seems likely to play a much greater role in financing the current round of projects .

some developing economies are regretting their decision to accept chinese loans .
in the us , a major infrastructure upgrade is long overdue , with politics , among other factors , impeding progress .

a century ago , china was driven to support wilson , and then to loathe him , by its own weakness .
now , china needs institutionalized mechanisms for enforcing the rule of law – one aspect of western political systems that xi admires – among cpc officials , though the idea that the judiciary could be independent of the party remains farfetched .
china ’ s national bureau of statistics ( nbs ) revealed last week that ten of the 70 large and medium-size chinese cities surveyed had recorded annual price increases of more than 20 % for newly built commercial housing . in the first-tier cities of shanghai and shenzhen , those gains were even higher : above 37 % .

more precisely , confusion about that policy has been roiling the markets .
yet , in contrast to the last round of renminbi depreciation , investors aren ’ t panicking .
but even the current regime is becoming difficult to manage .
one reason for the renminbi ’ s continued weakness in international finance is that , despite considerable progress since 2010 , it remains a half-baked international currency .
so when president xi jinping launched his “ new silk road ” initiative in 2013 , no one should have been surprised by the historical reference .
these new worries are raising alarm bells in china .
viewed in this context , the belief that the government ’ s approach to linyi reflects a new responsiveness to human-rights abuses seems naïve .
tokyo – as libya ’ s national transitional council attempts to establish a functioning government for a newly liberated country , the truth about what went on under col. muammar el-qaddafi ’ s regime is starting to come to light .
treatment is extremely limited where it is available .
such diplomatic realism need not lead to zero-sum outcomes , as the example of european integration demonstrates .
missile tests , pla military exercises and threatening rhetoric have been sufficient deterrents until now .
perhaps the speculative-inflow scenario will play out , but in slow motion .
instead of focusing on securing a soft landing today , chinese policymakers should be worrying about the brick wall that economic growth may hit in the second half of the quinquennium .

in recent years , research has indicated that vested interests and powerful lobbies distort economic policies and cause governments to miss good opportunities .
ironically , today ’ s pain stems from one of the great successes that emerging economies have achieved : the reduction of foreign-currency funding in favor of local-currency debt .
ultimately , even hurricane katrina and other disasters of similar magnitude are small by world standards .
the ip standards advanced countries favor typically are designed not to maximize innovation and scientific progress , but to maximize the profits of big pharmaceutical companies and others able to sway trade negotiations .
other reforms concern the patents themselves , and include shortening patent terms , introducing use-it-or lose-it provisions , and instituting stricter criteria that limit patents to truly meaningful inventions .
the trip ’ s scheme failed to recognize this .
google and alibaba now compete for the world ’ s top computer engineers , many of whom are european , in order to win the race to control the world ’ s data , develop quantum computing ( on which the next generation of encryption will rely ) , to create more profitable applications of artificial intelligence .
a similar court should do the same for crimes against the environment and its defenders .

his reply was always conditional .
still , the fight is far from over .
time , like money , is a scarce resource ; and , because goods and services related to information require our attention , they are time-intensive .
many governments have recognized this to some extent , setting ambitious goals for mobile internet coverage , broadband infrastructure , and public wi-fi access .

most rational analysts would argue that keeping the planet healthy enough to support a thriving economy in the long term is a good investment .
if each garment were replaced half as often , the industry ’ s total greenhouse-gas emissions would plummet by 44 % .
iran , after all , is not building an islamic bomb .
iran certainly regarded the meeting as a propaganda opportunity , promising wide media coverage at a time when it was in the eye of a diplomatic hurricane .
that year , he used diplomacy relentlessly and skillfully to achieve a breakthrough nuclear agreement with the soviet union , the limited test ban treaty .
it is in this labyrinth of power that rouhani is fighting an intense battle with his conservative adversaries – a battle that may be far from over .
and yet these outcomes do not necessarily amount to broken promises .
indeed , the two other options – iran ’ s emergence as a nuclear power or the use of military force to prevent this – would , in addition to all of its horrible consequences , also increase oil and gas prices .
but the agreement ’ s potential benefits can not be denied .
today ’ s low- and middle-income countries are only now entering a period of true sovereignty .

but the so-called joint comprehensive plan of action will be judged by its implementation , which will take years .
the consensus among the negotiating partners – one of the few points of agreement regarding the middle east among the security council ’ s permanent membership – was crucial in convincing iran to take the negotiations seriously .
but if iran ’ s hardliners were frustrated by previous negotiations , their disappointment vanished yesterday .
the result is the emergence of the islamic state , carrying with it the threat of extermination of the country ’ s minorities , including christians and alawites .
sanctions , while useful , work only in the very long term , and a change in the balance of power within the country is not foreseeable in the short term .
iran ’ s security forces are too strong and have too much at stake in the current system , which gives them control of vast swaths of the iranian economy .
india ’ s stance must be particularly troubling for trump .
in his speech at a gathering of sunni muslim leaders in riyadh , trump delivered a sharp and visceral rebuke of all things iranian – including , it seems , that country ’ s recent elections .
it is thus unfathomable that they would dictate to arab countries in any capacity .
but the same can be said of jewish and christian texts ; and the right to education , without discrimination , is guaranteed in several international declarations and covenants , such as the universal declaration of human rights , to which almost all countries , including iran , have agreed .
most worrisome of all , he is close to the two main groups that represent the most extreme elements in iran : the islamic revolutionary guard corps and the basij organization .
a disastrous possible policy – military attack on iran – has been headed off by a misguided , misinterpreted intelligence report .
when a national currency loses 50 % of its value in a matter of weeks , economic collapse is at hand .
yet few in the iranian establishment understand that being the leading regional power brings responsibility ; and that only responsible behavior can create legitimacy and acceptance that iran craves .
nor can it exercise its traditional functions in the religious sphere to provide support to civil society in the country .
reacting to mounting fear of western military action against iran ’ s nuclear facilities , revolutionary guard commanders recently sharpened their rhetoric against the us and israel .
what ’ s missing this time , however , is a charismatic leader comparable to khomeini .

it was bad enough to deal with sadr as a bandit ; simple political arithmetic now dictates that he will likely be the central figure deciding the outcome of october ’ s vote on the constitution .
the new shia elites who control iraq have emulated their allies in iran , creating a system that effectively chooses which of their rivals may constitute a “ legitimate ” opposition and which may not participate in the political process .
above all , the government must spare no effort in convincing poor iraqis of the value of democracy and freedom , and how important the constitution is in realizing their aspirations for a better life .
the easiest strategy for liberals is to side with conservative muslims who reject not only radical islamism , but also political reform .
the key to improving police operations is to embed more us and allied police officers in the police force to mentor iraqi officers .
for iraq , this is a brain drain that will be hard to repair .

warwick , uk – is academic freedom affordable in a time of economic crisis ?
· too many sectors of the us economy have not completed their balance-sheet rehabilitation process .
two economists , rudiger fahlenbrach and rene stulz , tested these implications by studying the ceos of almost 100 large financial institutions from 2006 to 2008 .
after all , the us went off the gold standard in 1933 , and the fed cut the discount rate to 1.5 % in 1934 , ending deflation ( except for minor episodes ) ; but the unemployment rate did not fall consistently below 15 % until 1941 and the onset of world war ii .

is gordon brown electable ?
given these factors , the jgb market , which has been stable so far , will face serious trouble in the years ahead .
first , overall demand for goods and services is much weaker , both in europe and the united states , than it was in the go-go years before the recession .
in past decades , large expansions of bank reserves caused lending surges that increased the money supply and fueled inflationary spending growth .
its response was to offer targeted and expedited debt relief – often by bringing in new temporary bankruptcy legislation that forced limited debt write-downs .
against this background , the notion that reclaiming territory from isis will amount to freeing the region of extremist groups is clearly naive .

how does the fed deal with such a situation ?
moreover , israelis and people close to hezbollah in lebanon are talking about “ another round , ” while many pundits in the middle east believe that a limited war could unblock a stagnant political situation .
but their arguments did not carry the day .
that reflects saudi arabia ’ s output increase of more than a million barrels a day , as well as mandated efficiency measures in the european union , partly motivated by efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions , which have contributed to a comparable drop in demand – by about 1.5 % a year .
palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas and his colleagues know perfectly well that un recognition by itself will not deliver an end to occupation and the full realization of a sovereign palestine .
some palestinians in the west bank and gaza objected to the accords ’ failure to call explicitly for the end of illegal israeli settlement building .
there was no public reaction when , after the gatekeepers was released , prime minister binyamin netanyahu ’ s office issued a statement saying he had not seen the documentary and had no intention of doing so .
bds is an “ anti-apartheid ” movement , comes the reply , adopting the methods and spirit of nelson mandela in south africa .
as recently as 2006 , ehud olmert had won an election in israel on a dovish platform , pledging to extend ariel sharon ’ s unilateral withdrawal from gaza to the west bank .
today , israel is relying on historical claims to occupy another people .
those prospects will diminish further if the annexationist jewish home , with whose domestic platform ( a liberal economy , a better deal for the middle classes , and military service for the orthodox ) lapid fully concurs , joins a likud-yesh atid government .
and there may indeed be cases where armed intervention is the only way to stop mass murder .
while the weakening and rollback of iran serves israeli strategic interests , israel will have to reckon with sunni islamist power everywhere in its vicinity , leading directly to a strengthening of hamas .
given that the palestinians ’ political leadership is divided between the fatah-led palestinian authority , which controls the west bank , and hamas , which has established an islamic fundamentalist regime in gaza , a deal between israel and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas would mean little .
this approach also lost credibility as a result of the rise of hamas and its determination to wage permanent war on israel ; iran ’ s expanding influence and nuclear weapons ’ program ; and the high – even rising – levels of hatred against israel among arabs and muslims .
israel ’ s lonely prosperity
such was the case of the 1973 war , which was started by president anwar sadat with the aim of forcing the united states to broker an egyptian-israeli peace .
the palestinian leader yasir arafat turned him down flat and instead returned to a massive campaign of terrorism against israel .
and it repeatedly uttered threats that “ all ” options are on the table .
the palestinian police have cooperated with the israelis to contain violence on the west bank .
in some cases , there is explicit cooperation with israel .
once people stop believing that israel is defending the west against fascism , israel will be blamed for all the violence in the middle east .
i have no first-hand knowledge of the legislative process in the united states .
it has impressive universities and a high education level , well- managed global companies , and a strong work ethic .
indeed , the opposition has access only to a few newspapers and radio stations , leaving the internet the sole remaining space of freedom in russia .
the dsm-iii ’ s confusion of normal intense sadness and depressive mental disorder , which persists to the present , emerged inadvertently from psychiatry ’ s response to challenges to the profession during the 1970 ’ s .
consequently , employment and wages have also increased .
this type of rescue strategy also makes it possible to increase the required supervisory equity-asset ratios of banks in the midst of the crisis without risking a credit crunch .
they need not be democracies , either : china , vietnam , and cuba come to mind .
given that china is the second largest economy in the world , it didn ’ t take long for european officials to reduce their own growth projections , and for the international monetary fund to revise downward its expectations for global growth .
some imports would become cheaper as well , benefiting american consumers .
unfortunately , that spirit did not end well , with both stock prices and corporate earnings crashing catastrophically at the end of the decade .
there are three reasons for europe ’ s changing politics .
following last year ’ s bailout , italy ’ s treasury owns about 70 % of the bank .
but italy is not just losing skilled , ambitious , and visionary workers .
why italy is the latest to question policy orthodoxy
and while some of the coalition ’ s popularity is due to support for unattractive policy positions – namely , the ruling parties ’ anti-immigrant stance and confrontation with the eu – it also reflects voters ’ desire for a modernized welfare state .
china , for its part , is rapidly advancing in these areas , creating significant opportunities for young people in the process .
the obvious candidates will not or can not take on the role : britain has excluded itself ; france is paralyzed until next year ’ s presidential election and possibly beyond ; and spain can not even form a government .
renzi , too , pursued limited reforms , but eventually fell prey to his own outsize ego .
bowing to this reality , the coalition partners have now dropped the idea of abandoning the euro , expunging the possibility from their “ contract ” and respective websites .
this sclerotic arrangement , however , has enabled those same right-wing populists to present themselves as the only alternative to “ the system . ”
at a time of substantial economic challenges – italy ’ s output has been stagnant for a decade , and its public finances remain precarious – the populist five star movement , which has pledged to hold a referendum on continued euro membership , may well tempt voters .
they are underwriting the narrative that renzi is the only person who can save italy from itself ; that may be the right bet – at least for the time being .
for example , tax evasion is pervasive , so increases disproportionately hit those who already pay , fueling a widespread perception of unfairness .
as if this was not enough , prodi will face another problem .
and those are just the official figures ; the actual numbers are probably much higher , possibly more than double .
russia envisions ukraine becoming something akin to bosnia – a radically federalized country comprising political units that each adhere to their own economic , cultural , and geopolitical preferences .
these assets are generally not followed by multiple analysts , and are not easily understood , giving him a greater advantage in applying his intellectual skills and the skills of others around him .
one small but important example of this is the average cost of setting up a business , which is €158 ( $ 212 ) in canada , €664 in the us , and €2,285 in the eu ( and as much as €4,141 in italy ) .
for now , such a perspective favors policy gradualism .
in america , the post-world war ii g.i . bill financed higher education for demobilized soldiers , and was a highly beneficial public investment in human capital .
some american strategists advocate a largely technological solution to this dilemma .
in fact , these moves might create new barriers to entry , entrenching market leaders and undermining innovation .
the us was far from consistent or perfect in this process , sometime to murderous effect in places like vietnam .
why ?
marginal parties that are not connected to political violence and do not incite hatred should probably be left in peace – distasteful as their rhetoric may be .
under koizumi ’ s leadership , insolvent banks were made whole again .
markets reacted sharply , with the yen strengthening by 2 % against the dollar and the japanese stock market falling 3 % .
brussels – demography is not destiny , at least not entirely .
in japan , where cognitive , academic scores are overly emphasized above holistic human development , this style of engagement with the arts , including music , can foster not only an appreciation of beauty , but also imagination , cooperation , initiative , leadership , empathy , and compassion .
even if japan took steps to become a “ normal ” country ( whatever that term may imply ) , it would still not equal the power of the us or china .
that is why abe is determined to amend , or at least reinterpret , japan ’ s constitution to allow for the kinds of defense maneuvers that other countries , from israel to india , employ when their people are threatened .
for the 30 years since the beginning of china ’ s economic reforms , chinese industry has achieved impressive efficiency gains by adopting new technologies and realizing economies of scale , leading to a huge expansion in locally made products suitable for export .
of course , the wealth of the government does play a role in economic performance .
such a scheme would include joint military exercises and information-sharing arrangements not just with south korea and the us , but also with china , india , the southeast asian countries .
what central banks can not achieve with traditional tools can now be accomplished through the circuitous channels of wealth effects in asset markets or with the competitive edge gained from currency depreciation .
and it is beefing up its relations with emerging giants like brazil , mexico , nigeria , and turkey .
he is particularly concerned with the constitutional provision that prohibits japan from maintaining “ land , sea , and air forces , ” arguing that it seems to be in direct contradiction with the existence of the country ’ s self-defense forces .
though the hike would have ostensibly served the objective of balancing japan ’ s budget , it also would have undermined consumption , which has yet to recover from the last tax hike , from 5 % to 8 % , implemented in 2014 .
japanese reactions reveal an extraordinary degree of stubborn self-righteousness .
because the dpj has neither an upper-house majority nor the two-thirds lower-house majority needed to override upper-house votes , his government will be unable to pass budget and/or appropriation bills by the end of the current fiscal year , march 31 , 2011 .
indeed , a landslide victory on the scale of abe ’ s may very well lead to some of them completely disappearing from political life .
rather , the japanese behave as they do because they are decent people .
asia ’ s new security landscape places a premium on seamless cooperation among us allies – a prospect that the sustained bickering between south korea and japan calls into question .
the world has been paying greater attention to reducing loss of life from disasters .
japan ’ s 150 million people still produce far more than 2.5 billion chinese and indians .
abe and his ministers were simply not provided with critical facts by the bureaucrats who are supposed to serve them .
for both reasons , a medium-term plan for some fiscal consolidation is desirable .
its style is almost scientific – factual , staccato-like , and unemotional – and it goes a long way toward meeting china ’ s demand for a convincing investigation and act of contrition that might allow the bitter and still poisonous past to be overcome .
this is why i support america ’ s strategic “ rebalancing ” to enhance peace and security in the asia-pacific region .
the election question
even with a significant deepening of ties , however , bilateral relationships alone will be inadequate to counterbalance china .
and they have provided only about $ 250 million in aid over the last decade – a paltry sum , given the potential consequences of afghan instability for china ’ s $ 6 trillion economy .
far from vindicating him , historians will know exactly whom to blame .
indeed , their relationship is now characterized by what the japanese call seirei keinetsu ( cold politics , hot economics ) .
india ’ s relationship with china may depend on this choice for many years to come .
yet european competitiveness is in danger .
and , despite the resistance of saudi arabia and the sunni opposition , the us and the eu currently seem more inclined to accept iran ’ s inclusion in the geneva ii negotiations , especially now that advances are being made in the implementation of the international agreement on iran ’ s nuclear program concluded in november .
ukraine thus could have maintained normal relations with its neighbors , with the eu , and with russia .
for europe , interdependence is strongly correlated with energy security .
alain peyrefitte , the scholar , politician , and confidant of charles de gaulle , said that “ without europe , france will be nothing ” ; but , without france , europe , too , would be nothing .
international negotiations with iran over its nuclear program have provided some reason for optimism , which could lend impetus to efforts in syria .
this endless search for the true locus of responsibility ( both causal and remedial ) is not restricted to the realm of climate change .
and the rest of the world does not seem to know how to stop its unrelenting advance .
emerging-market central-bank governors fear a us that alternates between expansionary policy that fuels huge hot-money inflows and a domestic inflationary spiral , and rapid tightening that chokes off credit and causes a domestic recession .
anyone with a laptop and an internet connection can gossip with ( or about ) virtual friends ; witness extraordinary events that may or may not have happened ; or play games in a mock world of incomparable complexity .
but the depiction of ideas as being somehow “ un-american ” has always been an epithet , not an argument .
put another way , globalization lowered the wages of low-skill advanced-country workers because others would perform their jobs more cheaply , and then consume the value that they had created .
instead , they are “ chosen by private equity firms to run the companies they control .
one thing is clear : economists no longer dare to assume that trend is trend and cycle is cycle , and that their reciprocal interactions are small enough to neglect on the first pass .
france has also undertaken ambitious reforms to reduce job-market dualism and give greater flexibility to employers as well as greater security to employees .
fortunately , the answer is a qualified yes : there are ways to ensure that fiscal accommodation now is followed by consolidation later .
in southern europe , investment has literally collapsed ; even in germany , it will reach pre-crisis levels only this year .
is there a better way ?
it may take time before agreement is reached and decisions are made , but the discussion is bound to resume .
furthermore , some countries have succeeded in reducing their public spending significantly without changing their social model altogether .
on the political front , the discussion is about what the eu should aim to become , and the post-election temptation is to give only one answer : less .
according to a cnn political analyst , it was “ the most important political speech of 2017 – and one of the most powerful political speeches in the modern era of the senate . ”
both scotland and the ruk might agree that scotland would temporarily keep the british pound but would move to a new scottish pound or the euro .
an urban sdg , promoting inclusive , productive , and resilient cities , would greatly empower tens of thousands of cities worldwide to take up the cause of sustainable development for their own citizens , their countries , and the world .
yet there was also frustration and bewilderment , as vocal opponents of foreign aid began to oppose the increased funding for disease control .
cynicism is rife on all sides .
but today ’ s games also create an opportune moment to look back at russia ’ s recent economic history – and to peer forward as well .
i know this from personal experience .
hardline approaches brought expanded conflicts in afghanistan , iraq , libya , and syria , leading to plenty of deaths but not to meaningful political or economic solutions in the affected countries .
there is even a place at the table for exxonmobil , chevron , bp , peabody , koch industries , and other oil and coal giants .
we have entered the age of sustainable development .
the result has been an unmitigated catastrophe : the destruction of iraq as a functioning society in an ongoing civil war , fueled by outside powers , that has caused economic ruin and collapsing living standards .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon has called for political leaders to attend a special summit in september 2014 , 14 months ahead of the paris meeting , to launch intensive negotiations .
by the criteria of international use as a reserve currency among central banks and as a vehicle in foreign-exchange markets , the most rapid declines took place from 1978 to 1991 and from 2001 to 2010 .
but the emerging-market countries have been so disunited that in 2011 they failed to support a common candidate for imf managing director .
indeed , it was ronald reagan ’ s administration that pioneered the use of cap and trade to phase out leaded gasoline in the 1980 ’ s .
even if good leadership means a demonstrated ability to prevail in the face of intransigent domestic political opposition , coup attempts , and invasions , surely no leader can be held responsible for the effects of droughts , floods , or other natural disasters .
if the borrower runs into trouble , cacs make it possible to restructure debt with the agreement of a substantial majority of creditors ( usually around 70 % ) .
jokowi and sisi seem to have adopted this approach .
second , there is the high compensation of corporate executives and people in finance .
but in this case we are talking about an ecb purchase of dollars that would change the euro money supply .
jeremy corbyn , the current favorite to become the next leader of britain ’ s labour party , is the latest victim of this chorus of disparagement .
of course , there is a certain logic to the public ’ s disdain for superstar compensation outside of professional sports and entertainment .
these risks can be managed effectively through proper treatment systems ( as in japan and south korea ) .
is this right ?
as a result , teachers spend their time in the most effective way possible – solving problems with students – instead of delivering undifferentiated lessons .
so , rather than hire in panic at the first sign of a recovery for fear that they will be unable to do so later and lose sales , firms would rather make sure that the recovery is well established before adding workers .
“ [ h ] istory teaches us that enmities between nations , as between individuals , do not last forever , ” he said .
mahmoud al-habbash , the palestinian minister of religious affairs , even went so far as to demand “ assurances that the talks won ’ t fail , ” because if they do , a new intifada would surely erupt .
in the case of johnny hallyday , it is perhaps not too farfetched to believe that this man of sphinx-like mystery is now , like baudelaire , “ a block of granite surrounded by vague fear ” whose “ fierce nature sings only to the rays of the setting sun . ”
brief and less complex interventions were also unsuccessful in ending violent crises – and in some cases even exacerbated them .
gains in south asia and north africa have been modest , while conditions in west asia have actually worsened .
first , the sanctions imposed so far – visa cancellations , asset seizures or freezes , and the like – will not give sevastopol back to ukraine , but they will eventually bite , at least in certain russian business sectors .
ultimately , brazilians may just be too unsure about handing power to silva , who has become a media phenomenon but remains an unknown quantity .
nonetheless , they have shown great restraint in northern iraq since saddam ’ s fall , contenting themselves with building up their autonomous province both economically and politically – to the point that it is independent in all but name , with a strong and experienced army in the peshmerga militia .
if this happens , iraq , lebanon , and jordan would not be left unaffected .
it has largely been germany that has opposed integrating europe ’ s energy and natural gas markets .
this would require securing control over these resources . it would also require establishing new export routes to europe that , by circumventing ukraine , would make the country vulnerable to blackmail , because a cutoff of gas supplies to it would no longer trouble europe .
emerging economies on their own
the bretton woods conference marked one of history ’ s greatest examples of international economic cooperation .
but these simple steps are easy enough to grasp – and within reach for everyone .
in 1999 , in elliot associates , lp v. banco de la nacion and the republic of peru , the second circuit court of appeals determined that the plaintiff ’ s intent in purchasing the discounted debt was to be paid in full or otherwise to sue .
most important , markets have never been very good at achieving structural transformations quickly on their own ; the transition from agriculture to manufacturing , for example , was anything but smooth ; on the contrary , it was accompanied by significant social dislocation and the great depression .
or , to put it another way , while the government is clearly doing some things that it should not , it is also not doing some things that it should .
there have to be rules of the game , and these are established through political processes .
indeed , the agreements have been used to challenge government actions ranging from debt restructuring to affirmative action .
new thinking is a natural consequence of high population density , provided the right conditions are met – conditions that include public spaces in which people can interact and culture can thrive , and a democratic ethos that welcomes and encourages public participation .
new york – there ’ s something dismal about writing year-end roundups in the half-decade since the eruption of the 2008 global financial crisis .
does he realize that since the era of deregulation and liberalization began in the late 1970s , gdp growth has slowed markedly , and that what growth has occurred has primarily benefited those at the top ?
zurich – the world ’ s health needs are changing dramatically .
a decade ago , telecoms infrastructure was almost non-existent .

it is also true that we do not have to buy any particular book or listen to an opera .
many other countries have now identified extremism as their single most important challenge .
immigration did rank at the top , but , as blair noted in his speech , anti-immigration sentiment was mainly against multicultural immigration , which had little or nothing to do with the eu .

too big to jail
but even if this scenario is possible in theory , it is unlikely to occur in practice .
in that possibility lies the well-being of us all .
for a group of people so committed to free markets and so enamored of “ creative destruction , ” that is a question that urgently needs to be addressed .
to be sure , many have suggested that the current crisis represents a vital opportunity to overcome these tensions and build an ever-closer union , citing the belief of jean monnet , one of the european union ’ s main architects , that crises are critical to spur progress toward integration .

allowing existing protectionist trade barriers to remain in place – or worsen – would not only deprive citizens in tpp countries of higher incomes ; it would also deal a damaging blow to international cooperation .
the us sovereign-debt market shows no similar evidence of having reached a limit yet .
what is required is a mechanism against “ social dumping ” that prevents poor labor practices in exporting countries from spilling over to the importing country .
similarly , incomes around the world would rise significantly from liberalizing more global trade in both goods and services .
this is worth bearing in mind , given that the fed ’ s adoption of qe in 2008 ( which it continued to pursue until last year ) had the effect of weakening the dollar from 2009 to 2011 , prompting the same accusations of “ beggar thy neighbor policies ” against the us that congressmen now level against others .

the us remains stuck in the time-worn mindset of a deficit saver with massive multilateral trade deficits and the need to draw freely on global surplus saving to support economic growth .
the scene is thus set for a sino-american showdown , with all of its weighty and unforeseeable geo-strategic implications .
when i have written in favor of freer trade and liberal immigration , i have been denounced as a “ curry nigger . ”
meanwhile , many university graduates – including a whopping 45 % in south korea – are struggling to find jobs .

after world war ii , high inflation in japan undermined confidence in the yen ’ s stability , leading many japanese to barter .
if those pushing for tax cuts stick to their guns and refuse to accept reality , their agenda , if enacted , would result in a significantly wider budget deficit , which would increase the national debt to unprecedentedly high levels .
another is to ensure that companies pay taxes – perhaps by lowering the corporate-tax rate for companies that invest and create jobs in america , and raising it for those that do not .
and then there ’ s the fact that iran , unlike most of its regional adversaries , is a functioning democracy .
given its economic size and favorable geography , structural forces would likely have produced some form of american primacy in the twentieth century .
america and the world in transition
their palaces were not just magnificent architectural structures , but also venues for maintaining social control .
instead , we should look at trump ’ s own analysis of existing agreements in the context of his views on issues such as national security and working-class jobs and incomes .
but a serious problem will arise if trump attempts to use it to protect his family – not a farfetched scenario , given pending fbi investigations into his inner circle ’ s dealings with russia .
they discount the dampening effect of nuclear weapons , which for more than four decades helped keep the cold war between the us and the soviet union from turning hot .
as it stands , it seems that trump is hoping to impress critics with headlines about what are actually small-bore accomplishments .
and so it was – and then some .

one reporter joked that the next press christmas party would be held at the recently opened trump international hotel down the street from the white house , and there would be a cash bar .

the decline of us influence , and the strengthening of china ’ s strategic clout , continues unabated .
and treasury bonds are secure : the federal government has not fallen into arrears on its debt since the disastrous war of 1812 .
in north korea , all of this dictated from the top .
china has a significantly larger population than the us does , so it stands to reason that it will surpass the us in nominal size at some point ( unless it were trapped in a permanent state of poor productivity ) .
but the yale historian donald kagan has shown that athenian power was in fact not growing .
and his team has drafted additional executive orders that will reduce or even terminate funding for international organizations and withdraw the us from multilateral treaties .
and trade and investment between taiwan and mainland china have flourished .
and xi has plenty of policy tools available to ensure that the chinese economy does not suffer any serious damage from us tariffs .
but addressing this issue requires technical expertise and negotiating skill , not blunt threats based on inadequate knowledge .
on the contrary , the paris accord is very good for america , and it is the us that continues to impose an unfair burden on others .
it is too early to say what the trump administration will do when it comes to climate change .
while globalization , and the trade openness that underpins it , has the potential to enrich the entire global economy , so far the richest have captured a hugely disproportionate share of the gains .
ultimately , demand for imports would fall , as would the benefits for consumers and new tax revenues for the government .
since then , the administration has carved out exemptions for certain us allies , while using the tariffs as a bargaining chip to extract concessions from others .
by july , the north was testing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the us , and it is believed that the country already possesses the capability to produce a miniaturized , icbm-ready nuclear payload .

the end result is underperformance of the saver ’ s retirement account .
today , it could undertake similar swaps , but with countries facing large capital outflows , thereby slowing the dollar ’ s appreciation .
with foreign earnings growing and foreign corporate-tax rates falling , deferral has become increasingly attractive .
but the real global fault line is the italian economy , which has not grown for nearly a generation .

but , while business leadership and collective action are needed to create a sustainable and inclusive economy ( a central message of our commission ’ s report ) , the private sector can not do it alone .
a trump presidency will lead to an epic geopolitical shift : for the first time since 1941 , europe can not rely on the us defense umbrella ; it now stands alone .
the french and german governments recently decided to move ahead on a plan jointly to develop a new fighter jet , which is certainly a good first step . but one should not expect to see any spectacular cooperative achievements in the immediate future .
given that the republicans also control both houses of congress – and will soon make many judicial appointments – there is virtually no effective constraint on the executive branch .

but while this assistance has done plenty of good , the attached strings are tying our hands .
the ongoing north korea crisis implies that the us-china relationship during the trump-xi era will be one of intense strategic competition .
the question is whether it can work in the real world .

by and large , the most successful bankers in recent years have been exactly the types of experts trump seems to avoid .
as socrates approaches the court , he runs into his friend euthyphro , a young man who is on his way to the same place to prosecute his own father for the slaying of another man .
and , relative to the likes of trump , putin does not look so bad at all .

none of these responses is constructive .
in recent weeks , israel has clashed with iranian forces in southern syria to show that it will not allow iran to establish a presence there .

that was certainly true after the two iraq wars .
evil has indeed often been the agent of good ( without hitler , no united nations , no pax americana , no european union , no taboo on racism , no decolonization , no keynesian economics , and much else ) .
as defenders of a non-exclusive , rights-based creed , liberals are compelled to meddle in the affairs of other countries whose policies don ’ t accord with liberal values .
needless to say , not everyone is as optimistic as trump .
the simple truth is that saudi arabia can not distance itself from the palestinian cause and allow other countries like turkey and even iran to carry the banner .
of course , that is not how trump ’ s administration presents it .
if the new crown prince is worried about his domestic political standing , he will be reluctant to stand shoulder to shoulder with an american president seen as too close to an israel that is unwilling to satisfy even minimal palestinian requirements for statehood .
and , more to the point , they were successful : their eventual assassination of conrad of montferrat led directly to the political collapse of the crusader coalition and the defeat of richard the lionheart of england .
more to the point , he will explain the logic of why sanctions must be suspended before he can even start to lay the groundwork for denuclearization .
despite these different possible interpretations , the trump administration seized on kim ’ s statements as a sure sign that north korea is ready to disarm .
instead , trump will win praise for “ forcing ” china into a negotiation that it never resisted and averting the risk of a trade war that he himself created .
third , this undesirable policy mix of excessively loose fiscal policy and tight monetary policy will tighten financial conditions , hurting blue-collar workers ’ incomes and employment prospects .
explaining these unexpected responses could provide a glimpse of what the next few months have in store for markets .
he wants to make it even smaller , and to avoid granting fundamental sovereign rights , such as control over land , air , water , and border crossings .
san jose , california – marco polo , the famous thirteenth-century venetian merchant , was one of the first europeans to trade with china .
but let us take at face value , if only for the sake of argument , that the trump administration wants to renegotiate nafta in good faith .
that has made mexico an attractive location for assembling asian-produced content into final manufactured goods for sale in the us or canada .
but trump showed little interest in following up on the attack with diplomacy .
before they became obsessed with iran and the muslim brotherhood , arab leaders often began meetings with us officials by railing against israel .

finance is complex , and a lot of devils could be , and were , hidden in the details .

for its part , nato does have a deeply integrated command structure for the forces that are assigned to it .
the fate of the 12-country trans-pacific partnership trade agreement seems already to have been sealed , with trump assuring the public that he would shelve that deal – concluded but not ratified by the us senate – on his first day in office . this is unfortunate , as the tpp would have revolutionized intellectual property rights and boosted transparency to unprecedented levels , while lowering tariff and non-tariff barriers .
( because deputy attorney general rod rosenstein must make the call to dismiss mueller , and has said that he sees no reason to do so , trump would first have to fire rosenstein , which would look too much like the saturday night massacre , the turning point in nixon ’ s presidency . )
trump may not like it , but he must call out kim ’ s duplicity , especially given the latest intelligence .
as many have pointed out , the terrorism list is by no means a complete compendium of countries whose security services may have been involved with terrorist groups .
to be sure , pakistan could respond to such sanctions by blocking america ’ s overland access to afghanistan , thereby increasing the cost of resupplying us forces by up to 50 % .
and he signed off his tweet announcing that he had made a decision on the paris accord with the words , “ make america great again ! ”
in this sense , are we living in the époque of trump , in which trump ’ s revival of the “ america first ” slogan of the american nazis in the 1930s has encouraged a loosening of bigoted tongues ?
the president ’ s daughter , ivanka trump , is spearheading the effort .
the benefits are diminishing with the rise of the euro and china ’ s renminbi as competing reserve currencies .
democracies require leaders to answer too many questions , jump through too many hoops , and face too much resistance .
martin luther king , jr. benefited from growing up in an african-american church tradition rich in the rhythms of the spoken word .
only in a full-blown crisis can popular opinion effectively determine who becomes leader .
arguments that it was necessary , or even “ optimal , ” to skew financial support from the government toward banks and their executives are not persuasive ( at least , not outside wall street ) .
its leader rails against foreigners , erects various import barriers , and pushes for low interest rates and lots of cheap credit for favored sectors .
more important , who would want it to work ?
and , of course , trump will still claim that the us economy can grow at a rate of 4 % , even though all mainstream economists , including republicans , agree that the potential growth rate will remain around 2 % , regardless of his policies .
responsible journalists report that trump white house aides ( who are notoriously sieve-like ) say the us president feels alone and cornered .
we should ignore his impetuous accusations and relentless contradictions .

first , the “ brexit ” referendum is part of a global phenomenon : populist revolts against established political parties , predominantly by older , poorer , or less-educated voters angry enough to tear down existing institutions and defy “ establishment ” politicians and economic experts .
the final consequence of brexit is that the uk would lose its free-trade arrangements with third countries under the many trade agreements that the eu has signed since 2000 .
but it should not lead the rest of europe to favor brexit .
some britons ( perhaps even a majority ) , and many other eu citizens , still want future generations to think of themselves as europeans ( albeit with a proud british , german , or spanish origin ) , and are prepared to take another shot at reforming europe ’ s governance structures . and they are right to think that the world would be a far better place with a united , democratic europe as a major force for both stability and change .
this will leave non-euro countries such as denmark , poland , and sweden forming an outer ring of economic cooperation outside the eurozone .
that would make it far too easy to avoid regulations , such as rules of origin , with a non-eu country exporting goods to ireland for onward shipment to the uk , or vice versa .
to help the may government stave off disaster for british manufacturing , the european commission has graciously agreed to a 21-month “ implementation period ” that will follow the uk ’ s official exit on march 29 , 2019 .

the eu ’ s leaders insist that the uk can not have free trade with the single market without allowing free movement of people .
at present , the country benefits even when parts of a product are manufactured elsewhere in europe , up to an agreed limit .
the decision to leave the eu will dominate british national life for the next decade , if not longer .
and yet 52 % of those who voted preferred a country where poles and romanians would not be permitted to live , work , and compete for a position on the economic team .
finally , great britain ’ s decision about its relationship with the eu will not happen in a vacuum .
today , as europe faces difficult questions about its future , exemplified in the uk ’ s upcoming referendum on its european union membership , perhaps germany ’ s experience in the late nineteenth century can be brought usefully to bear .
but it now may be set to hold another highly consequential vote .
the question is whether “ brexit ” would be as glorious as its proponents like to imagine .
but trump has also pledged to put “ america first ” in all deals it makes and actions it takes , particularly regarding trade .
just over half of uk voters chose “ brexit , ” a result that has cast a long shadow over their country ’ s political system and economic prospects .
they are just not the thing .
china , for its part , is attempting a difficult economic rebalancing , from an export-led to a consumption-based growth model .
yet talk has rarely translated into action , despite the record-low interest rates of the past eight years .
poznan – the current economic crisis cast a pall over climate change talks held this month in poland . while negotiators hoped for concrete progress towards an international climate agreement , the world ’ s two largest polluters were distracted – the us with preventing a collapse of the financial system in the midst of a presidential transition , china with a slowdown in domestic investment and weakening foreign demand for its manufactured goods .
they devised an electoral system whereby poles would not vote for candidates of their choice , but would cross out those they did not want – which is to say , each and every communist .

in a recent poll of british economists by the centre for macroeconomics , two-thirds agreed that austerity had harmed the uk economy .
speeches , particularly when delivered by leaders of great nations , can be useful , irrelevant , or dangerous .
it will need to convince labour politicians that collaboration with brexit is electoral suicide , and persuade pro-eu tory rebels that a rebellion would not be futile .
indeed , continuity is the one election outcome that can almost certainly be excluded .
sadly , we will probably get both .
in addition to accepting free movement of people , eea members must follow eu commercial rules and accept decisions by the european court of justice , without any formal role in making these rules and decisions .
in this scenario , budget cuts create room for interest rates to fall .
it is not just that tough measures will be required to rein in public spending for years to come . more worrying is that many voters seem to be in denial about that fact .
the british perceive themselves as doing rather well , whereas europe is doing badly .
more important , cameron has said almost nothing about either europe or immigration ; and , though miliband ’ s clearly stated pro-eu stance has endeared his candidacy to many business leaders , he , too , has played down the issue .
but before i place that bet , i will consider what the bookies have to say .
the allergy to industrial policy is particularly acute among those who equate it with subsidies and tax breaks .
they are destroyers , not creators .
the non-euro group – including britain , denmark , sweden , poland , and some other eastern european countries – would continue to elect representatives to the european parliament and participate fully in eu institutions . meanwhile , the euro group would pursue far greater fiscal integration , in addition to their current cooperation .
consider this simple fact : tripling mobile internet access over the next 15 years could make the developing world $ 22 trillion richer .
after all , they are seasoned innovators , as exemplified by google ’ s collaboration with vodafone in new zealand and telefónica in chile to deliver broadband to rural areas through atmospheric balloons .
bellevue , washington – when business leaders get together to talk about innovating their industries , they typically focus on initiatives like improving government funding for basic research , or building technology hubs and incubators .

while there is no scientific way to link a particular hurricane such as katrina to the long-term trend – in the sense that katrina might have been bad luck rather than a sign of manmade climate change – the energy of hurricanes throughout the world has been rising markedly .
but the supreme court 's rulings affirm the fundamental principle that even grave dangers do not warrant the sort of blanket deference to which the bush administration believes it is entitled whenever it utters the words `` war '' and `` terrorism . ''
hardliners in israel naturally regret the end of the bush administration , for they know that , even if president barack obama does not dramatically change us policy toward israel once he assumes power , he will not repeat bush ’ s unconditional support .

for too many of these countries , economic growth in the last two decades relied on a combination of two factors : a natural rebound from previous financial crises ( as in latin america ) or political conflicts and civil war ( as in africa ) , and high commodity prices . neither can be relied on for the productive transformation that developing countries need .

china and a new balance of power
however , in terms of non-income indicators of poverty – for example , child mortality , malnutrition , and school dropouts – india ’ s performance has been dismal ( in some respects worse even than in sub-saharan africa ) .
for both camps , only great-power politics matters for china ’ s national security , and if diplomacy can not influence the balance of power , there is little reason to engage with an issue .
i find it intriguing to go back almost 200 years and consider britain ’ s political economy when the first industrial revolution was gathering steam .

the chinese auto industry is capable of building 40 million cars per year for a market that currently consumes 26 million .
yet the billions of dollars china is spending on its charm offensive have had only a limited return .
despite early signs of trouble – which , together with the soviet union ’ s experience , should give the cpc pause – china seems to be determined to push ahead with the bri , which the country ’ s leaders have established as a pillar of their new “ grand strategy . ”
of course , if chinese policymakers could have predicted what has now happened in the world economy , they might have been less stringent in trying to rein in growth .
as a result , soes , which have long specialized in single markets or products , have now begun to recognize that they need to re-tool to compete both in china and in global markets .
but , as china ’ s economy continues to modernize , much work remains to be done .
though china ’ s high national savings rate means that it does not have to borrow liquidity from abroad or print large amounts of money , the risks it faces should not be underestimated .
though exports have declined considerably from their pre-crisis peak of 35 % of gdp , they continue to account for about 24 % , leaving china exposed to the global growth cycle – especially to markets in the developed world , where demand is exceptionally weak .
it previously brushed aside regional concerns about the alteration of natural-flow patterns to push ahead with the xayaburi and don sahong dam projects .
within china , a second displacement occurred : the government implemented a ¥4 trillion ( $ 680 billion ) stimulus package in november 2008 to offset weak demand in its major export markets .
over the years , china has worked to transform its closed , planned economy into a more open , market-based system .
in addition to exporting its comparative advantages , china also deploys “ patient capital , ” which has a maturity of ten years or more .
china ’ s dangerous digital agenda
as in a game of go , china ’ s leaders need to move the country ’ s pieces – that is to say , effect change in the soes ’ business models – in the right place , at the right time , and in a coordinated fashion .
beyond an awareness of the short-term risks of competitive devaluation lies the chinese government ’ s serious commitment to its longer-term goal of shifting the country ’ s growth model from one based on investment and exports to one driven by domestic consumption .
that is why the real test of china ’ s administrative reforms is whether , through improved bankruptcy mechanisms and regulations that block fraud and market manipulation , they allow – and even facilitate – the effective functioning of market forces .
originally conceived by former premier zhu rongji – one of modern china ’ s most strategy-minded reformers – the cdf quickly became a high-level platform for engagement between senior chinese policymakers and an international lineup of academics , foreign officials , and business leaders .
social returns from such investments far exceed the costs of capital .
the 11.3 % year-on-year gain in exports recorded in june stands in sharp contrast with earlier years , which were adversely affected by a weaker post-crisis global recovery .
succumbing to the temptation of massive monetary and fiscal stimulus , such as that pursued in the wake of the global economic crisis , would not only fail to boost growth in a sustainable way ; it would actually undermine growth and stability in the medium to long term .
but it left in its wake some serious problems for the chinese economy .
moreover , the very weak performance of state-owned enterprises , which continue to play a large role in heavy industry and in some service sectors , represents a powerful brake on growth .
some experiments have had less clear results , making , say , a positive contribution to gdp growth , but also contributing to problems like excess industrial capacity , pollution , corruption , and the creation of ghost towns .
my recommendation for western commentators , then , is to focus on how the chinese economy evolves in the meantime .
now that the government is working to reach the most remote people – those without access to roads , electricity , or clean water – the cost exceeds $ 200 per year .
gaining access to the advanced technologies and management expertise of european firms is another major enticement .
provided other countries do not overreact , trump ’ s protectionism need not be as costly as many accounts make it sound .
and the growth of special economic zones ( sezs ) in the 1990s turned china decisively toward integration with the world economy .
at the upcoming fifth plenum , china ’ s leaders must build on this progress , agreeing to keep up the reform momentum .
early this year , the state council , china ’ s cabinet , made lowering funding costs for businesses , especially small and medium-size enterprises ( smes ) , a top priority .
it should be noted that china has been able to circumvent the mundell-fleming model only when the renminbi is subject to upward pressure .
avoiding these four traps will be extremely difficult .
for china ’ s sake , and that of its neighbors , one hopes they stick to the free-market plan .
an authoritarian regime has no such automatic adjustment mechanism .
of course , with turkey ’ s term at the g-20 ’ s helm having barely begun , xi probably has not yet settled on specific priorities .
many fear that this is only the beginning of a long conflict that could include weapons – and casualties – far outside the realm of trade .
perhaps more important , with the country still importing large volumes of commodities and the rest of developing asia set to generate a new surge in commodity demand , the prospects for a commodity-price rebound look brighter .
more generally , some development experts have raised concerns about whether the aiib can operate according to international standards of governance and transparency , enforce safeguards , refuse to work with incompetent or corrupt governments , and follow effective procedures .

the sun shines only during the day , and even then , cloud cover disrupts the solar energy reaching photovoltaic panels .
abroad , china ’ s rise has caused admiration , envy , suspicion , and even outright hostility in some corners .
first , as plummeting stock prices caused the equity in investors ’ accounts to fall below the maintenance margin , brokers began issuing margin calls , forcing investors to offload more assets to come up with the needed cash .
the share of energy investment going into renewable electric generation has increased steadily , reaching 50 % in 2011 , up from 32 % just four years before .
in south korea , growth fell to 4.8 % .
pollution remains a grave challenge as well .
according to the world bank , only 13 of 101 countries classified as middle income in 1960 had reached high-income status in 2008 .
but that does not make it a sustainable model .
slashing the state sector abruptly and expecting to achieve transformation through austerity is not the way forward .
this development creates new opportunities for other developing countries to reap the trade benefits of inserting themselves into the international division of labor .
finally , and most important , the country is suffering from inadequate progress on market-orientated reform .
the longer the standoff lasts , the more likely it is to sully xi ’ s carefully cultivated image as a powerful leader , and that of china as asia ’ s hegemon , which would undermine popular support for the regime at home and severely weaken china ’ s influence over its neighbors .
the transition to a carbon-based economy liberated economies from age-old malthusian constraints .
what they do should interest everyone – especially us policymakers .
they can not be easily subverted by an authoritarian regime , no matter how many cultural exchanges or language institutes it builds .
i argue in my book mass flourishing that the right model is the good economy , which is an economy that offers the good life .
so companies are developing uniquely chinese approaches to such innovation .
yet this admirable country now faces an existential challenge .
it is true that china ’ s aid model differs from the west ’ s .
and that means that westerners who have spent considerable time in china and consider themselves seasoned “ china hands ” need to ask why they have gotten it so wrong .
but china will most likely move toward an open , largely rules-based multilateral framework .
in fact , one of the most baffling features of china ’ s economic rise is that , even amid double-digit gdp growth , employment grew at a measly 1.8 % average annual rate from 1978 to 2004 .
china does not want a divided asia or fragmented regional blocs built along geopolitical fissures , so it is cultivating international comity through shared interests .
xi ’ s reforms , like deng ’ s , reflect the absence of alternatives .
with the risks of inflation and asset bubbles being mitigated by lower oil prices and excess capacity , now is a good time to initiate this policy shift .
it seems that the lesson from the fall of soviet leader nikita khrushchev in 1964 was not lost on xi .
in july 2017 , the pboc decided to make an additional change to the rate-setting rule to correct for “ big market swings ” and “ irrational herd behavior . ”
are they right to worry ?
and president xi jinping ’ s crackdown on corruption has had the side effect of delaying decision-making and inhibiting new projects .
any fiscal stimulus now should focus on improving public services , encouraging consumption , and increasing household income .
add to that the recent surge in fast-growing , innovative companies – such as huawei , alibaba , and wanda – and china is well placed to implement xi ’ s ambitious vision .
given that the project will entail significant chinese investment affecting some 50 countries , its appeal in the developing world is not difficult to fathom .
in 1947 , however , following president franklin d. roosevelt ’ s election to four terms in office , congress enacted the twenty-second amendment to the us constitution ; since its ratification in 1951 , us presidents have been limited to two four-year terms .
the chinese armed forces are now well equipped , but lack comparable battlefield experience .
the good news is that such infrastructure can be built in an efficient and cost-effective manner .
beyond physical and emotional trauma , violators of the one-child policy – who are most often among the country ’ s poorest – face serious economic penalties .
this process has been accelerated by a confluence of defense-industry reforms , comprehensive military upgrading , and integration of innovative operational concepts .
and while trump ’ s communication style remains striking , particularly in comparison to xi ’ s , it becomes far less appealing when one is the target of his blunt comments on touchy topics .
now , however , that operating environment has changed ; in fact , the foundations of the post-cold war order were fraying long before trump arrived on the scene .
the recent increase in demand for housing may reflect households ’ desire to hedge their high savings against inflation or , more fundamentally , the sense that they must secure housing urgently , given limited supply .
from the perspective of structural adjustment , china ’ s declining dependence on fixed-asset investment should be hailed as an achievement .
if china does not reduce that share and cut its greenhouse-gas emissions , keeping global warming in check will prove impossible .
to change this , the government needs to promote market-based credit allocation .
according to beyond the supercycle : how technology is reshaping resources , a new report from the mckinsey global institute ( mgi ) , these trends are slowing the growth of primary energy demand .
by process of elimination , the only option that remains is tightening capital controls .
its recovery has outpaced that of other advanced economies ; job creation has been impressive ; and the dollar has been strong .
designated clearing banks have not exactly been flooded with business .
investment should be reined in by imposing greater financial discipline on wayward public enterprises , while the social safety net should be strengthened , so that households would not have to save so much to meet the costs of having children and growing old .

in 50 years , computers might be doing everything from driving taxis to performing routine surgery .
when mao zedong took power in 1949 , his immediate goal was to re-establish the “ greater china ” of the qing dynasty ( 1644-1912 ) , insisting that the manchu-led empire was the permanent and enduring china .
with countries in asia , eastern europe , and latin american fearing that , having reached the international middle class , they could be stuck there , greece and argentina shed light on how that might happen .
a similar degree of complacency was evident in the united states before the collapse of lehman brothers in september 2008 .
though the creditors ’ logic was sound and their intentions laudable , the greek side believed that such a condition would amount to an affront to their country ’ s sovereignty .
as greece and other eurozone countries have already learned , attempting to rush fiscal adjustment increases the debt burden , as the liquidity squeeze and concomitant uncertainty undermine output and reform efforts .
finally , the privatization fund at the center of the new program will do nothing to encourage structural reform .
easing greece ’ s debt burden while keeping the country within the eurozone is the correct and achievable path out of the crisis , and it can be accomplished easily through a mutual accord between germany and greece , to which the rest of europe will subscribe .
never mind moral-hazard problems or insolvency .
moreover , the easier medium-term payments will be made contingent not only on growth , but also on new “ conditionalities ” ( read : austerity measures ) imposed by the ( renamed ) troika .
the political will of the eurogroup was to ignore our proposals , let the negotiations fail , impose an indefinite bank holiday , and force the greek government to acquiesce on everything – including a massive new loan that is almost triple the size we had proposed .
many of its citizens are hungry .
greece has also once again reminded us of how badly the world needs a debt-restructuring framework .
given this , the new greek government is entirely justified in questioning the terms that the country was given .
but the truth is that the recession in greece has little to do with an excessive debt burden .
by focusing the qe debate on risk-sharing , draghi managed to distract germany from an infinitely more important issue : the enormous size of the qe program , which completely defied the german taboo against monetary financing of government debts .
but the reality of the talks is very different .
if that meant that the eu would end up bribing erdoğan with several billion euros in order to violate international legislation protecting refugees like shabbir , so be it .
new york – the greek euro tragedy is reaching its final act : it is clear that either this year or next , greece is highly likely to default on its debt and exit the eurozone .
on june 19 , i communicated to the german government and to the troika an alternative proposal , as part of a document entitled “ ending the greek crisis ” :
meanwhile , the eurozone will likely be more open to foreign investment out of necessity , and cash-rich chinese companies should continue to pursue opportunities via fdi or corporate acquisitions .
why are european union leaders resisting the referendum and refusing even to extend by a few days the june 30 deadline for greece ’ s next payment to the imf ?
may they act in a way that prevents greece from ever having to face the true , tragic meaning of sunday ’ s vote .
many academic studies have found that the rate of convergence tends to be about 2 % per year .
greece ’ s creditors and partners , for their part , must provide the fiscal space needed for the reforms to work .
so far , the greek crisis has been treated as a recurring emergency , rather than the structural problem that it is .
the united states then let it be known that president barack obama and treasury secretary jack lew had been trying to convince german chancellor angela merkel and finance minister wolfgang schäuble to offer debt relief to greece , also without success .
but progress toward what ?
munich – after months of games and brinkmanship , and only a week after greek voters rejected the conditions for a €7.5 billion ( $ 8.2 billion ) rescue package , the end came swiftly .
apparently , varoufakis believes that his “ sophisticated grasp of game theory ” gives greece a crucial advantage in “ the complicated dynamics ” of the negotiations .
even after two bailout packages , it is unrealistic to expect greek taxpayers to start making large repayments anytime soon – not with unemployment at 25 % ( and above 50 % for young people ) .
berlin - “ it ’ s when the tide goes out that you find out who has been swimming naked , ” the legendary investor warren buffett aptly remarked when the global economic crisis hit .
the story would have been very different if the need for substantial debt reduction had been accepted upfront .
and greek banks and firms lose their creditworthiness alongside their government if markets perceive the latter to be insolvent .
the requirements of the latest rescue deal are the toughest yet – even tougher than those that greek voters overwhelmingly rejected in a referendum earlier this month .
moreover , instability would become chronic , because the eurozone would no longer offer a backstop for fiscal and financial laxity .
after all , the private sector has long been regarded as an economy ’ s most important source of innovation .
new york – recent data suggest that the rate of contraction in the world economy may be slowing .
america ’ s fiscal and external deficits will not disappear just because the chief magician at the federal reserve waves his wand and says abracadabra .
defending his creation , volcker harks back to a simpler time for the financial system , and refers to “ overly liquid , speculation-prone securities markets . ”
new haven – it was inevitable .
a fully functioning monetary union also requires a central bank that is free to act as required to confront liquidity and confidence shocks , some mutualization of government debts , and centralized control over fiscal policy .
given this , china ’ s economic slowdown since the first quarter of 2010 has apparently been caused mainly by external and cyclical factors .
so do cross-border borrowing and lending through stock and bond markets .
rather than concerning themselves with how to balance growth and inequality , policymakers would do better to focus on how policies impact average incomes and other welfare indicators .
german voters balk at any suggestion that we should limit the environmental damage caused by big and expensive cars . british voters line up behind the truck drivers when protests are launched against hikes in the price of petrol , not least through the introduction of higher energy taxes .
but the jailing of liu also demonstrates in the starkest terms that china ’ s neglect of human rights is flowing to the rest of world alongside the mass of chinese goods .
work-and-retire or invest-and-retire visas , for example , would encourage expats to save and accumulate pension funds – thereby enabling them to contribute even more significantly to the region ’ s rapid economic growth .
third , the implementation of a wellbeing metric to guide policies would have the most rapid – and radical – effect at the national level .
greece , too , is turning over the reigns of government to an unelected , and supposedly apolitical , technocrat , lucas papademos , a former vice president of the european central bank .
he even exaggerates it , if necessary .
tucker ’ s proposal makes good sense , but it is difficult – and arguably unethical – for charities that raised money to help haitians now to divert some of those funds to programs to mitigate the damage caused by future earthquakes .
likewise , foreign minister mahmoud al-zahar of the hamas-led government says that any dissolution of the government or call for early elections by abbas would be a recipe for civil war .
hamas has put pressure on all resistance groups in gaza to refrain from provoking israel .
egypt certainly does , having made it clear that a divided palestinian leadership without a public mandate , like the one to be delivered by new elections , will be unable to carry out serious negotiations or win popular support for any eventual agreement .
this is a very ambitious program , probably impossible to achieve .

even in the habitually euro-skeptical united kingdom , prime minister david cameron has sought to boost his international credibility by highlighting his close ties with merkel , rather than by emphasizing the uk ’ s “ special relationship ” with the united states .
the conventional wisdom now holds that the world avoided a repeat of the interwar catastrophe , largely because policymakers made better decisions this time around .

but now japan ’ s political and economic influence in south east asia is gradually declining , owing in part to its failure to exert influence over security and defense matters .
will kim respond to that isolation recklessly , by continuing to antagonize the south , or pragmatically , by becoming more flexible ?
following kim ’ s response , sanctions should be tightened even further , to stop all trade with north korea , including halting all fuel imports .
sixty years after the end of the korean war , south korea is well equipped to take the lead in the event of a north korean collapse .
to be sure , claims that the north was showing restraint were clearly premature : north korea has since fired three short-range ballistic missiles from its east coast into the sea , and , more ominously , launched a ballistic missile over northern japan .
but as the two us allies , who were once bitter enemies , improve their bilateral security relationship , china and russia both fear that a close us-japan-south korea alliance could emerge as the equivalent of a mini-nato to their east .
as we know , of course , life in north korea is anything but amusing .
the us and south korea have also canceled military exercises and relaxed their force posture , respectively , easing the pressure on the kim regime .
a us commitment not to attack north korea with conventional or nuclear weapons was also included in the deal .
rather than a potent arsenal with credible long-range capabilities , it would have an unreliable arsenal with potentially no miniaturized nuclear warheads .
so , like in 1962 , there is a need for a strategic solution .
it may not be true for much longer .
nonetheless , north korea has shown little interest in reform .
now it appears that china is beginning to lose patience .
a second set of options would employ military force , either against a gathering north korean threat or one judged to be imminent .
but all nuclear powers would have to forswear so much as threatening to use nuclear weapons on the korean peninsula .
the united states first tried to resolve the issue back in 1994 , with the us-north korean agreed framework ; but that effort gradually collapsed , owing to actions taken – and not taken – on both sides .
kim kyong-hui has returned to the methods of her father , the dynasty ’ s founder , kim il-sung , who viewed party control as the most convenient and reliable means of exercising power .
the constitution ’ s writers were undoubtedly aware that jews had long been persecuted in other countries , but they concluded that it was not norway ’ s problem .
when corruption hurts partners with that level of clout , it hurts you , too .
since china ’ s multilateral surplus is the economic issue and many countries are concerned about it , the us should seek a multilateral , rules-based solution .
for example , in july , the international monetary fund commendably announced a substantial increase in concessional lending to least-developed countries .
the writer james baldwin put the case for “ progressive ” patriotism well : he loved america more than any country in the world , and for that reason insisted on the right to criticize her perpetually .
first , the middle east turmoil could affect global markets if one or more terrorist attack were to occur in europe or the us – a plausible development , given that several hundred islamic state jihadists are reported to have european or us passports .
moreover , the deep causes of last year ’ s turmoil in emerging markets have not disappeared .
nor does it include asia ’ s geopolitical risks arising from the territorial disputes between china and many of its neighbors , including japan , the philippines , south korea , and vietnam .
russia ’ s lack of reform and adverse demographic trends imply low potential growth and insufficient financial resources to create the fiscal and transfer union that is needed to bring other countries in .
the fed ’ s exit from qe will be slow , keeping interest rates low .
similarly , the risk of deflation worldwide has been contained via exotic and unconventional monetary policies : near-zero interest rates , quantitative easing , credit easing , and forward guidance .
but this year is different .
as saunders and his colleagues observe in their journal article , “ this was the case in the uk in 1700 , is the case in the undeveloped world not on grid electricity in modern times , and is the case for the developed world in modern times using the most advanced lighting technologies . ”
as my colleagues and i put it in our book-length report nuclear weapons : the state of play 2015 , launched in geneva , vienna , and washington in march : “ on the evidence of the size of their weapons arsenals , fissile material stocks , force modernization plans , stated doctrine and known deployment practices , all nine nuclear-armed states foresee indefinite retention of nuclear weapons and a continuing role for them in their security policies . ”
to that end , it is vital that neither country modernizes its nuclear arsenal in a way that is seen as expanding its nuclear capabilities .
the problem is that fusion involves joining two positively charged nuclei – and , as basic science shows , same-sign charges repel each other .
and china ’ s approach toward north korea seems to be changing , spurred by the nuclear issue .
if india��s demand is acceptable , why should other technologically advanced npt signatories , such as brazil , egypt , saudi arabia , and japan – to say nothing of less responsible nations – continue to restrain themselves ?
and , by doing so , it has cemented its status as a rogue state .
rather , it is that our most deadly weapons could be compromised in an instant .
the united nations has declared 2016-2025 the “ decade of action on nutrition , ” and the un ’ s sustainable development goals encourage comprehensive strategies for improving health , eliminating hunger , and promoting sustainable agriculture .
the elections earlier this year , which many at first assumed were a sham , now appear to have produced changes to which asia ’ s countries will need to collectively and individually respond .
if we are to get our policies right , it is crucial that we get our facts right .
president-elect obama has shown pragmatism and realism , and seems to understand that accepting limitations is not weakness ; refusal to acknowledge reality is .
voters concluded that even his own party no longer supported him , and his popularity fell further .
if european sensitivities must be assuaged , greece ’ s debt repayment could be drawn out over 100 years .
in syria , a central element of such an approach would have been engagement with assad .
given the kim regime ’ s past negotiating tactics , obama is understandably reluctant to launch any new diplomatic initiative and may well believe that negotiating with north korea would provide his domestic political opponents with ammunition to ruin his iran deal .
actually , he has not handled them very much , at least not in public .
in this sense , congressional intransigence may have undermined america ’ s position in its competition with china for global power and influence .
in truth , his visit to africa is a reward to his stalwart african-american supporters , who voted overwhelmingly for him in the november election and who remain one pillar of his base .
of course , even leaders who are more like obama than trump struggle to apprise themselves of everything that is going on .
obama ’ s visit to india can help to realize that relationship ’ s potential .
the same middle-of-the-road approach can be taken in the second year to address the still-outstanding fiscal issues .
moreover , it was under truman that the first great step in america ’ s civil-rights revolution , the desegregation of the army , took place .
he would likely accomplish far more if , instead , he offered an explicit promise that the us would come to the gcc countries ’ defense against external aggression in all its forms .
but , come election day , many ( if not most ) americans are likely to ignore recent history and vote against the incumbent .
second , obama did not seriously seek to resolve existing us-china economic disagreements , particularly over trade .
but obama might soon realize that most of his predecessors started as believers in international cooperation , until events forced them to fall back on a strategy of confrontation .
pandering to israel ’ s uncompromising policies may be the easiest way for america ’ s democratic president to avoid trouble in an election year .
he has registered the us congress ’ s hostility toward iran and the desire to confront the islamic republic militarily .
the new strategic arms-reduction treaty , which is still a work in progress , and the ctbt have already aroused skepticism from opposition legislators and opinion-makers .
a man without a plan
obama managed two other major achievements before republican obstructionism took hold : the dodd-frank financial reform bill and the affordable care act ( aca , also known as “ obamacare ” ) .
obama ’ s proposals to boost job creation are convincing , whereas romney ’ s proposals would have little or no effect – and some could even make matters worse .
and , given similar per capita income levels and cultural orientations , overlaps in production and consumption are considerable .
applied appropriately and with a healthy dose of common sense , economics would have prepared us for the financial crisis and pointed us in the right direction to fix what caused it .

cyber security is regarded as complicated and costly ; but cyber offense is seen as inexpensive and sexy .
mindless subsidies that we can not afford will not create a green economy ; what will is investment in research and development to bring down costs , so that green energy eventually can outcompete gas .
but it is costly in terms of both money and energy : a coal-fired power station that adopts ccs must burn even more coal in order to produce the same amount of energy .
after the explosions at deepwater horizon and ixtoc , oil and gas under high pressure entered the water at the seabed .
as a first step , the gcc states are moving toward new tax regimes in early 2018 , including a value-added tax , a corporation tax , property taxes , and taxes on fuel , tobacco , and alcohol .
growth in the eurozone will be based on the resulting increase in domestic demand , rather than exports .
any economics textbook would recommend exactly this outcome .
a decline in oil prices is to some extent a zero-sum game , with producers losing and consumers gaining .
my answer is that oil companies need to complete the commodity-analysis quest that i started but never finished .

a better arms control system would undoubtedly make it more difficult for non-nuclear weapons states to acquire nuclear capability ; but it is hard to see why reductions alone , however dramatic , in the huge number of american and russian warheads should induce aspiring nuclear powers to give up their nuclear ambitions . even if america and russia agreed to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear warheads from 5,000-6,000 each to 1,000 each , why should that stop iran from wanting to build 50-100 nuclear warheads and short-range delivery systems if it perceives this to be in its national interest ?

more important , american isolationism – based on a false belief that the us was safely protected by two oceans – allowed nazi germany and imperial japan to wage aggressive war and threaten the entire world .
in the israel-palestine conflict , the historical narratives are overwhelming , and the geography is small , so details can not be glossed over .
the incendiary rhetoric of palestine ’ s supporters in the arab world has never done much for the palestinian people , either .
after the fighting was over , israel controlled all of the west bank , gaza , and jerusalem , in addition to the sinai peninsula and the golan heights .
if the us appears to be seeking regime change or a preemptive war , a panicked kim will be more likely to lash out .
all told , north korea ’ s “ opening ” will most likely amount to much less than meets the eye .
at that time , china – pointing to its own experience with the us – proposed that the us and north korea each open a diplomatic office in the other ’ s capital .
but there could be a less unflattering , though equally depressing , explanation .
things are not much better on the economic-policy front .
of course , sentiment can go in both directions .
in france , the far-right national front ’ s marine le pen will attempt to turn the upcoming presidential election into another anti-establishment upset .
in any case , trump seems to have no interest in bringing in experts .
he likens trade deficits to economic losses – almost to theft – and declares china the enemy .
but none of this is supported by the evidence . even nafta skeptics have concluded that its negative effects on net us manufacturing employment have been small to non-existent .
the electoral process is essentially a zero-sum game for the participants .
but tillerson has distanced himself from trump , and rumors are circulating in washington that he already wants out .
much of that disruption has come from america ’ s free-trade relationship with china , a very large country which has a far lower per capita income .
trump failed to heed that historical lesson , which suggests that , like bush , he doesn ’ t know what the mission is .
this week , house speaker paul ryan , heretofore a trump loyalist who had let some of his republican flock take unprecedented actions to undermine mueller ’ s probe , sent tremors through washington when he let it be known that he thought it unwise for a president to pardon himself .
russian president vladimir putin ’ s kleptocratic regime has sent troops into one former soviet republic , georgia ; invaded and occupied part of a second , ukraine ; and harassed and tried to intimidate three others – estonia , latvia , and lithuania ( all three of them nato members ) .
doing so will require patience , which is not trump ’ s strong suit .
at that point , iran would feel free to redeploy its proxies against israel , starting with hezbollah in neighboring lebanon .
is walking away from the iran nuclear deal , as many supporters of the new us administration are demanding , conducive to easing the crisis in the middle east ?
the master of the kremlin is sure to have taken note of this .
for starters , the us must maintain strong ties with its two regional allies – japan and south korea .
but more steps are needed .
under the agreed deal , all participating countries are free to determine their own emissions-reduction targets and the policies for achieving them , and they may make revisions as they see fit .
still , trump can not take all of america with him .
among the middle three quintiles , the effective rate in 2013 was 13.8 % , down from an average of 16.6 % over the three previous decades .
eliminating federal subsidies for health-insurance coverage under the affordable care act ( “ obamacare ” ) would save the government a little over $ 100 billion a year , about 3 % of federal spending .
the trade war is a ham-fisted and nearly incoherent attempt by the trump administration to stall china ’ s economic ascent by trying to stifle the country ’ s exports and access to western technology .
donald trump ’ s dark art of the tweet
the passage giving his controversial speech its name alluded to inner city riots in the united states and invoked virgil : “ like the roman , i seem to see ‘ the river tiber foaming with much blood . ’ ”
the koch brothers , with a combined net worth of some $ 100 billion , have spent freely for decades to take over the us political system , mobilizing other right-wing corporate interests as well .
diffidence and arrogance is a fatal combination for a secretary of state , yet that is precisely what tillerson displayed – and he rarely seemed to have a good day in the job .
the cut in corporate taxes that the republicans are likely to support will not boost wages significantly .
and proposals for a border adjustment tax have been all but forgotten .
and many are expecting a major downturn in the next five years ; otherwise , the economy would have experienced an almost unheard-of decade-and-a-half expansion .
adding to the turmoil was the publication of bob woodward ’ s latest book , fear , which ( like previous books on trump , but to a greater extent and with more depth ) offers a devastating portrait of a dysfunctional white house .
apparently , he thinks that trade surpluses and deficits amount to profit and loss statements for countries .
another major difference today is that many firms are a part of global value chains , whereby goods are assembled in countries like mexico or china from imported components , the most sophisticated of which often come from the us .
at a rally in august , trump reiterated threats about imposing a 25 % tariff on automobiles – particularly those from the european union .
in helsinki , putin confirmed that he had wanted trump to win the election – a calculated move , no doubt , that he knew would seem to corroborate accusations that trump ’ s presidential campaign colluded with the kremlin .
how could such a keen observer of the us , whose former career as a spy honed his ability to decipher people ’ s motives and intentions , fail to recognize the falseness of trump ’ s promises ?
in the early hours of september 2 , 2015 , in bodrum , turkey , a syrian kurdish family boarded a dinghy to try to reach greece .
nonetheless , bukharin aligned with stalin to purge leon trotsky and other bolsheviks who sought to adhere more closely to lenin ’ s dictates ( and his testament against stalin ) .

in 1847 , hungarian obstetrician ignaz semmelweis demonstrated that he could greatly reduce maternal deaths in his clinic simply by having doctors sterilize their hands .
but this option isn ’ t likely to go anywhere , either .
the dossier by former british spy christopher steele about us president donald trump ’ s activities in moscow some years ago may turn out to be as credible as the claims that saddam hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction – or it may not . we simply don ’ t know .
political paths that seemed parallel just a few months ago are now diverging .
political stability may be more surely gained by europe ’ s recommitment to its social-democratic economic model .
it is far too soon to say what , exactly , trump ’ s presidency will mean for asia .
it is certainly not just in america that people desire a sense of vocational accomplishment , rather than simply money to live on .
the truth is that , thanks to extensive experience designing and implementing cost-effective aid programs , poorly used funds represent a tiny fraction of the total invested in aid .
but russia took that deal out of self-interest , not because of the trump administration ’ s obsequiousness .
while wto adjudication takes time and effort , more often than not the rulings have favored the us .
that challenge is to shape the global economy , including trade , so that it finally respects the planet ’ s natural boundaries .
but if the eu had agreed on a ver , european producers would have received that $ 4 billion from higher sales revenues , and for them this sum would have been a very important shot in the arm , allowing them to invest in higher productivity and more sustainable production .
if the tariffs really are about national security , they must be placed on imports mainly from close allies like canada , mexico , japan , and the eu .
if bannon wants to transform the american political landscape , an impeached or defeated trump could become an ideal martyr for his movement .
he is of the world of stagecraft more than statecraft , of pageantry more than policy .
and these change , not just with time , but according to who speaks , when , and where .
but trump now knows what to do to be admired as a great leader .
and the eu ’ s house is fragile : it already taxes car imports from the us at 10 % , compared to the 2.5 % tariff the us has in place for car imports from the eu .
now , he has ordered steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum ( 25 % and 10 % , respectively ) , basing the move on a rarely used national-security exception to world trade organization rules .
meanwhile , the eu and asian steel-importing countries , like india and indonesia , are preparing to adopt safeguard measures to counter a potential surge of imported steel diverted from the us .
nearly four decades after reagan ’ s alleged supply-side revolution , déjà vu is in the air . it ’ s the scent of an approaching storm .
in his 1931 macmillan report to the british parliament , keynes proposed that an import tariff be paired with an export subsidy , which would mimic the effects of exchange-rate devaluation , while maintaining the gold-pound parity .
yet we can not take it for granted .
under president donald trump ’ s administration , the american government does not even bother to pay lip service to democracy anymore .
and we must fight to uphold the nuclear deal with iran and nuclear non-proliferation around the world .
the consequences of trump ’ s trade strategy aren ’ t confined to asia .
and with the yields on government bonds also very low , investors ’ animal spirits were running high , boosting the price of many risky assets .
for better or for worse , the globalization train has long since left the station , and the idea that one can turn it back is utterly naive .
with trump , those good times may be about to come to an end .
and his brazen willingness to challenge the 40-year-old “ one china ” policy by speaking directly with taiwanese president tsai ing-wen – to say nothing of his subsequent anti-china tweets – leaves little doubt that his administration will follow navarro ’ s prescription and take dead aim at america ’ s largest and most powerful trading partner .
depending on the discipline , anywhere from 24 % to 80 % of scientists and engineers employed in the us are foreign-born .
if trump cuts taxes and manages to enact a massive infrastructure program , america ’ s budget deficits will rise , perhaps dramatically .
the mistake is to slash the overall budget , rather than reallocate funds and increase outlays on vitally needed programs that fight hunger and disease , educate children , and prevent conflicts .
europeans should not have to compromise their genuinely held concerns about privacy just to promote trade , which is simply a means ( sometimes ) to achieving higher living standards .
similarly , the united kingdom has just added £7 million ( $ 9 million ) , bringing its total contribution for the current year to £45.5 million .
since being inaugurated before a phantom crowd of millions , trump has picked fights with one government after another , including allies like australia and germany .
but it is also another area where obama set the bar high during his two terms .
vienna – barack obama was right to say that democracy itself was on the ballot in the just-concluded us presidential election .
trump likes headlines and most likely he would prefer a favorable news cycle or two , given the recent gyrations in financial markets .
yet the us – and only the us – now rejects the security council ’ s role in such matters .
this must be the premise of any effort to establish the truth about what happened .
our lives no longer feel ground under them .
clearly , the industrial jobs that are missing in the us have also gone missing in japan and germany , and those jobs are not in mexico .
i claimed in the book that , in the absence of a more concerted government response , too much globalization would deepen societal cleavages , exacerbate distributional problems , and undermine domestic social bargains – arguments that have become conventional wisdom since .
thus , to the very limited extent that tariffs do prove “ punitive ” for china , the effect on other emerging markets and the global economy will not be damaging “ contagion ” but a modest boost to demand that results from displacing chinese exports to the us .
with trump scheduled to meet chinese president xi jinping at the g20 summit in argentina this week , the us may have one last chance to turn things around .
when the us deployed its terminal high altitude area defense system in south korea , china used its economic leverage to retaliate against south korea , but not against america .
as soon as a few experts are found to have been offering half-truths – or worse – the credibility of the entire field can be called into question .
regling may not be a major player in his own right , but he never speaks out of turn or contradicts the ecb and the german government .
no matter how much their directors may want to focus on the diseases that kill the most people , the current system of financial incentives means that if they did so , their shareholders would remove them , or their companies would soon be out of business . that would help no one .
and , unlike the us , middle eastern countries and their neighbors can not decide to “ pivot ” away from the region when the consequences of their poorly designed interventions become too unruly .
in european-turkish relations , two trains are racing headlong towards each other .
for many politicians , particularly in america , there is an unwillingness to upset turkey without strong justification , given its record as a loyal nato ally and putative eu candidate country .
tensions rise , often accompanied by violence on the streets .
at its peak , during the week of august 8-15 , the currencies of argentina , south africa , and turkey depreciated by 8-14 % against the us dollar .
my father-in-law was the alleged mastermind of the sledgehammer plot , so my wife and i found ourselves moonlighting as forensic detectives and political activists .
but the turkish government also hopes to prevent the establishment of an independent kurdistan that could project its influence into southeast turkey .
this influence does not imply a hegemonic relationship , but rather points to an alternative path for reform and economic development that other primarily muslim countries might take .
turkish democracy ’ s secret weapon
during this period , turkey would face severe political , economic , and security pressures not only from the us and other nato states , but also from russia , iran , and others .
though careful not to challenge the constitution openly , from 1971 to 2001 , they were successively banned as threats to secularism .
all told , the campaign and vote fell far short of established international standards , as election monitors from the organization for security and cooperation in europe have pointed out .
in their view , turkey had re-oriented its foreign policy toward the muslim middle east and away from the west – a shift supposedly reflected in the country ’ s deteriorating relations with israel and improving ties with iran and syria .
given that the government can change laws , name judges , and staff the state administration , turkey ’ s slide to another political model could reach a point of no return .
those who wish to express a kurdish identity , as well as all other citizens , must be confident that , while all remain committed to national unity , turkey is a country in which diversity can thrive .
but this assumes that europe is willing and able to benefit from what turkey has to offer .
unfortunately , the international community as a whole has so far performed poorly in providing an effective response to the crisis .
the headscarf that gül ’ s wife wears for religious reasons was seen as an assault on turkey ’ s sacrosanct principle of secularism .
according to the syrian observatory for human rights , at least 70 civilians – and 21 children – have been killed during the operation , while more than 100 sdf soldiers have perished , including one female soldier whose body was mutilated by turkish forces .
as an emerging power , turkey will continue to realize its own potential and simultaneously contribute to global peace .
there is one thing , however , that could revive the eu , give it much enhanced global respectability , and make it an “ interesting ” place , as well as ensure a return to the international limelight : turkey ’ s admission as a full member .
soon , the us was providing weapons and training to the pyd ’ s armed wing .
indeed , it is one reason why saudi arabia maintains an equal distance from all iraqi factions , and why we are the only country not to have sent a permanent ambassador .
so the best the world can currently hope for is revived dialogue , an agreement to freeze the north ’ s yongbyon nuclear plant , and perhaps a moratorium on further missile and nuclear tests .
unfortunately , the problem of nuclear arms is still very serious today .
although entering peace talks with a future modi government would risk provoking a domestic backlash , sharif might still be willing to break the ice if the main political parties support his moves .

as a perpetual overdraft drawn from the bundesbank , this money was not unlike the international monetary fund ’ s special drawing rights , except that there is much more of it – a sum greater than all of the funds imf countries are willing to loan to one another .
europeans ( germans in particular ) , on the other hand , enjoyed the `` rhineland model '' : a market economy that harnesses economic success to the cause of social justice .
meanwhile , president xi jinping ’ s anti-corruption campaign increasingly looks like a strategy to consolidate power , rather than an effort to reform china ’ s state for the benefit of its economy and society .

the taxpayer is not called upon , even in extreme cases , and states can go bankrupt .
employers ’ associations join with strong trade unions to organize and run training schemes at the sectoral level .
since the end of the cold war , the us has been involved in seven wars and military interventions , and in 2006 , after the invasion of iraq , george w. bush issued a national security strategy that was almost the opposite of trump ’ s , promoting freedom and a global community of democracies .
in a country that has spent the past five decades building an economy from a standing start , the government in which i serve knows only too well that such figures , while showing that our development is progressing , do not tell the whole story – or anything like it .
uber and other digital platforms are redefining the interaction among consumers , workers , and employers .
this educational paradise is not in a rich country with unlimited resources ; it is in a refugee camp in western uganda .

such an alliance would make yushchenko 's rule , if he wins , more difficult - and he knows it .
for our movement is a triumph , not of mobs but of joyous crowds ; of protests , not of looting ; of clear purpose , not confusion .
when spending is high , it is usually social spending that is badly targeted , which means that only a small share of poor people really benefit .
indeed , this did happen with the one property recovery that my government was able to secure , the giant kryvorizhstal steel works that our former president ’ s son-in-law gained through a rigged sale at a bargain price .
a yanukovych restoration would be a disaster for ukraine , for russia , and for europe , because it would put ukraine ’ s independence in question and tempt russia with dreams of renewed empire .
western sanctions against russia have certainly highlighted the seriousness with which the eu and the united states view putin ’ s efforts to challenge and undermine the core principles of european security and international law .
similarly , the potential for union-led bargaining to redistribute income presupposes non-competitive corporate practices , which in turn generate abnormal profits that can be bargained away by unions .
how convincing is that answer today ?
but may ’ s problematic approach to immigration extends back further .
in other words , the un ’ s foundations , laid down in 1945 , remain strong .
this experimental approach by central banks has involved the conscious decoupling of financial-asset prices from their fundamentals .
add to that the smart use of state resources , together with sure-footed reforms , and china should be able to achieve moderate yet sustainable long-term growth .

even as china defied world trade rules , forced companies to share their intellectual property , and flexed its military muscles , the us held onto the naive hope that , as china became increasingly prosperous , it would naturally pursue economic and even political liberalization .
today , china sells $ 4 worth of goods to the us for every $ 1 in imports .
this does not bode well for the world ’ s capacity to confront shared challenges , from migration to climate change .

what they fail to acknowledge is that there is also plenty they can do to make the global trading system – and their relationships with china – fairer and more efficient .
today , with the economy normalizing , the case for creative policies like qe , which effectively shortens government debt by sucking long-term bonds out of the market , seems much weaker .

good regulation means more than just preventing the banking sector from harming the rest of us ( though the fed didn ’ t do a very good job of that before the crisis ) . it also means adopting and enforcing rules that restrict the flow of funds into speculation and encourage the financial sector to play the constructive role in our economy that it should , by providing capital to establish new firms and enable successful companies to expand .
