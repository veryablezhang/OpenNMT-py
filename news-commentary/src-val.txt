a large part of the eu ’ s task is to prepare this legislation .
first , the “ brexit ” referendum is part of a global phenomenon : populist revolts against established political parties , predominantly by older , poorer , or less-educated voters angry enough to tear down existing institutions and defy “ establishment ” politicians and economic experts .
the final consequence of brexit is that the uk would lose its free-trade arrangements with third countries under the many trade agreements that the eu has signed since 2000 .
but it should not lead the rest of europe to favor brexit .
some britons ( perhaps even a majority ) , and many other eu citizens , still want future generations to think of themselves as europeans ( albeit with a proud british , german , or spanish origin ) , and are prepared to take another shot at reforming europe ’ s governance structures . and they are right to think that the world would be a far better place with a united , democratic europe as a major force for both stability and change .

the new ftt might still face political opposition in europe , especially in the united kingdom , with its large and influential banking sector , but at least the principle of greater tax fairness is high on the european agenda .
progress on this front must continue .
but the longer-term subject will be getting as many countries as possible into the global nato security network .
one powerful way to boost the world economy and to help meet future needs is to increase spending on key infrastructure projects , mainly directed at transportation ( roads , ports , rail , and mass transit ) , sustainable energy ( wind , solar , geothermal , carbon-capture and sequestration , and long-distance power transmission grids ) , pollution control , and water and sanitation .
such a turnaround has happened before .

good and bad capitalism
this ceiling can be raised only in a deep depression or other exceptional circumstances , allowing for counter-cyclical policy so long as it is agreed that the additional deficit is cyclical , rather than structural .
by 2011 , anti-globalization rhetoric had largely faded , and globalization is thought of as not something to be neither fought nor cheered , but as a fundamental characteristic of the human story , in which disparate geographies and diverse themes are inextricably intertwined .
there was a push to give money to iraq – a country rife with corruption – while other countries were accused of corruption without adequate hard evidence or specific details .
so the old partners need new ones .
cuba ’ s octogenarian ruling brothers can not last forever .
someone in a garage somewhere is gunning for us , and 2015 could be the year that they make their move .

the euro , meanwhile , suffered its own crisis .
paris – since the financial crisis erupted in 2008 , governments in advanced countries have been under significant pressure .
sometimes the risk entails the proverbial “ revolving door ” between government and business , through which personnel glide from senior private-sector jobs to top official posts and back again .
likewise , the british government spends markedly more of its budget on such intangibles than on tangible assets .

when mao zedong took power in 1949 , his immediate goal was to re-establish the “ greater china ” of the qing dynasty ( 1644-1912 ) , insisting that the manchu-led empire was the permanent and enduring china .
with countries in asia , eastern europe , and latin american fearing that , having reached the international middle class , they could be stuck there , greece and argentina shed light on how that might happen .
a similar degree of complacency was evident in the united states before the collapse of lehman brothers in september 2008 .
though the creditors ’ logic was sound and their intentions laudable , the greek side believed that such a condition would amount to an affront to their country ’ s sovereignty .
as greece and other eurozone countries have already learned , attempting to rush fiscal adjustment increases the debt burden , as the liquidity squeeze and concomitant uncertainty undermine output and reform efforts .
finally , the privatization fund at the center of the new program will do nothing to encourage structural reform .
easing greece ’ s debt burden while keeping the country within the eurozone is the correct and achievable path out of the crisis , and it can be accomplished easily through a mutual accord between germany and greece , to which the rest of europe will subscribe .
never mind moral-hazard problems or insolvency .
moreover , the easier medium-term payments will be made contingent not only on growth , but also on new “ conditionalities ” ( read : austerity measures ) imposed by the ( renamed ) troika .
the political will of the eurogroup was to ignore our proposals , let the negotiations fail , impose an indefinite bank holiday , and force the greek government to acquiesce on everything – including a massive new loan that is almost triple the size we had proposed .
many of its citizens are hungry .
greece has also once again reminded us of how badly the world needs a debt-restructuring framework .
given this , the new greek government is entirely justified in questioning the terms that the country was given .
but the truth is that the recession in greece has little to do with an excessive debt burden .
by focusing the qe debate on risk-sharing , draghi managed to distract germany from an infinitely more important issue : the enormous size of the qe program , which completely defied the german taboo against monetary financing of government debts .
but the reality of the talks is very different .
if that meant that the eu would end up bribing erdoğan with several billion euros in order to violate international legislation protecting refugees like shabbir , so be it .
new york – the greek euro tragedy is reaching its final act : it is clear that either this year or next , greece is highly likely to default on its debt and exit the eurozone .
on june 19 , i communicated to the german government and to the troika an alternative proposal , as part of a document entitled “ ending the greek crisis ” :
meanwhile , the eurozone will likely be more open to foreign investment out of necessity , and cash-rich chinese companies should continue to pursue opportunities via fdi or corporate acquisitions .
why are european union leaders resisting the referendum and refusing even to extend by a few days the june 30 deadline for greece ’ s next payment to the imf ?
may they act in a way that prevents greece from ever having to face the true , tragic meaning of sunday ’ s vote .
many academic studies have found that the rate of convergence tends to be about 2 % per year .
greece ’ s creditors and partners , for their part , must provide the fiscal space needed for the reforms to work .
so far , the greek crisis has been treated as a recurring emergency , rather than the structural problem that it is .
the united states then let it be known that president barack obama and treasury secretary jack lew had been trying to convince german chancellor angela merkel and finance minister wolfgang schäuble to offer debt relief to greece , also without success .
but progress toward what ?
munich – after months of games and brinkmanship , and only a week after greek voters rejected the conditions for a €7.5 billion ( $ 8.2 billion ) rescue package , the end came swiftly .
apparently , varoufakis believes that his “ sophisticated grasp of game theory ” gives greece a crucial advantage in “ the complicated dynamics ” of the negotiations .
even after two bailout packages , it is unrealistic to expect greek taxpayers to start making large repayments anytime soon – not with unemployment at 25 % ( and above 50 % for young people ) .
berlin - “ it ’ s when the tide goes out that you find out who has been swimming naked , ” the legendary investor warren buffett aptly remarked when the global economic crisis hit .
the story would have been very different if the need for substantial debt reduction had been accepted upfront .
and greek banks and firms lose their creditworthiness alongside their government if markets perceive the latter to be insolvent .
the requirements of the latest rescue deal are the toughest yet – even tougher than those that greek voters overwhelmingly rejected in a referendum earlier this month .
moreover , instability would become chronic , because the eurozone would no longer offer a backstop for fiscal and financial laxity .
after all , the private sector has long been regarded as an economy ’ s most important source of innovation .
new york – recent data suggest that the rate of contraction in the world economy may be slowing .
america ’ s fiscal and external deficits will not disappear just because the chief magician at the federal reserve waves his wand and says abracadabra .
defending his creation , volcker harks back to a simpler time for the financial system , and refers to “ overly liquid , speculation-prone securities markets . ”
new haven – it was inevitable .
a fully functioning monetary union also requires a central bank that is free to act as required to confront liquidity and confidence shocks , some mutualization of government debts , and centralized control over fiscal policy .
given this , china ’ s economic slowdown since the first quarter of 2010 has apparently been caused mainly by external and cyclical factors .
so do cross-border borrowing and lending through stock and bond markets .
rather than concerning themselves with how to balance growth and inequality , policymakers would do better to focus on how policies impact average incomes and other welfare indicators .
german voters balk at any suggestion that we should limit the environmental damage caused by big and expensive cars . british voters line up behind the truck drivers when protests are launched against hikes in the price of petrol , not least through the introduction of higher energy taxes .
but the jailing of liu also demonstrates in the starkest terms that china ’ s neglect of human rights is flowing to the rest of world alongside the mass of chinese goods .
work-and-retire or invest-and-retire visas , for example , would encourage expats to save and accumulate pension funds – thereby enabling them to contribute even more significantly to the region ’ s rapid economic growth .
third , the implementation of a wellbeing metric to guide policies would have the most rapid – and radical – effect at the national level .
greece , too , is turning over the reigns of government to an unelected , and supposedly apolitical , technocrat , lucas papademos , a former vice president of the european central bank .
he even exaggerates it , if necessary .
tucker ’ s proposal makes good sense , but it is difficult – and arguably unethical – for charities that raised money to help haitians now to divert some of those funds to programs to mitigate the damage caused by future earthquakes .
likewise , foreign minister mahmoud al-zahar of the hamas-led government says that any dissolution of the government or call for early elections by abbas would be a recipe for civil war .
hamas has put pressure on all resistance groups in gaza to refrain from provoking israel .
egypt certainly does , having made it clear that a divided palestinian leadership without a public mandate , like the one to be delivered by new elections , will be unable to carry out serious negotiations or win popular support for any eventual agreement .
this is a very ambitious program , probably impossible to achieve .

that is why a group of public intellectuals from around the world has created the independent commission for the reform of international corporate taxation ( icrict ) , which i chair .

former president khatami ’ s initial decision to run for the post again grabbed the international community 's attention .
ahmadinejad ’ s “ vision ” at the un could be dismissed as political posturing if it weren ’ t for a string of similar statements and actions that suggest he believes that he is destined to bring about the “ end times ” – the end of the world – by paving the way for the return of the shia muslim messiah .

the euro was supposed to bring shared prosperity , which would enhance solidarity and advance the goal of european integration .
but that is where the similarity between him and powell ends .
to turn a feudal kingdom into a modern nation-state , saudi arabia needs to address its internal weaknesses ; it does not need more combative alliances and colossal arms deals like the one its leaders signed with trump on his recent trip to riyadh .
this allowed for a faster and more orderly restructuring than otherwise would have been possible .

london – many people have long believed that if government and the private sector agreed to share their data more freely , and allow it to be processed using the right analytics , previously unimaginable solutions to countless social , economic , and commercial problems would emerge .
these efforts have the additional benefit of ensuring that nigeria cements its polio-free status .
rising food and energy prices pushed inflation up to 9.7 % in may , from 8.2 % in april .
moscow – throughout his years in power , eduard shevardnadze was known as the “ silver fox , ” a man who seemed to glide effortlessly from leader of soviet georgia and kremlin politburo member to mikhail gorbachev ’ s reform-minded foreign minister , before reemerging as post-soviet georgia ’ s pro-western president , ironically opposing gorbachev .
putin is only 61 , a decade younger than the leaders who led the soviet union to the precipice , and the constitution permits him to remain in power for at least another ten years .
one sign of this is china ’ s lack of the necessary institutions and rules .
we do not , after all , have a normal administration that can be served honorably .
should we deal with the few remaining alawite leaders whose hands are not stained with blood , or those members of assad ’ s clan who chose exile early and thus were not involved in the massacres ?
so , had britain adopted the euro , two things would have happened with certainty : there would be no uk referendum on eu membership , and greece would not be the domino that fell first .
instead , the ldp , having failed to reinvigorate itself and attract allies , has occasionally taken a buck-passing approach , such as permitting the dpj to pass an unpopular but inevitable and necessary increase in the consumption tax .
america ’ s fond hope to contain terrorism regionally promises instead to ensure that afghanistan and pakistan remain a festering threat to regional and global security .
indeed , according to the un high commissioner for refugees , 34 % of the 137,000 people who arrived in the eu from january 1 to june 29 were from syria , with the next-largest contributor , afghanistan , accounting for 12 % .
with blinkered analysis and misplaced concern , the academics essentially say that to reduce global warming slightly , we should end growth that can lift hundreds of millions out of poverty , avoid millions of air pollution deaths , and give billions the opportunity of a better life through improved health care , shelter , education , and income .
but , just before its takeover by microsoft , nokia actually built a line of android-based phones called nokia x , which did not include google apps , but instead used nokia maps and microsoft search .
if a bank is too big to fail , regulators should go even further , and regulate proprietary traders ’ compensation packages to ensure that risks and rewards are properly aligned .
and they got good grades .
the democrats had argued that the increase in the debt ceiling and extension of appropriations should last for only three months , thus forcing the republicans to take electorally risky votes before the 2018 elections .
globalization is the only answer
and , finally , higher inflation causes distortions to relative prices and to the tax system – distortions that have potentially significant costs , and not just in recessions .
the process by which southern europe became uncompetitive in the first place was driven by market price signals – by the incentives those signals created for entrepreneurs , and by how entrepreneurs ’ individually rational responses played out in macroeconomic terms .
but now japan ’ s political and economic influence in south east asia is gradually declining , owing in part to its failure to exert influence over security and defense matters .
will kim respond to that isolation recklessly , by continuing to antagonize the south , or pragmatically , by becoming more flexible ?
following kim ’ s response , sanctions should be tightened even further , to stop all trade with north korea , including halting all fuel imports .
sixty years after the end of the korean war , south korea is well equipped to take the lead in the event of a north korean collapse .
to be sure , claims that the north was showing restraint were clearly premature : north korea has since fired three short-range ballistic missiles from its east coast into the sea , and , more ominously , launched a ballistic missile over northern japan .
but as the two us allies , who were once bitter enemies , improve their bilateral security relationship , china and russia both fear that a close us-japan-south korea alliance could emerge as the equivalent of a mini-nato to their east .
as we know , of course , life in north korea is anything but amusing .
the us and south korea have also canceled military exercises and relaxed their force posture , respectively , easing the pressure on the kim regime .
a us commitment not to attack north korea with conventional or nuclear weapons was also included in the deal .
rather than a potent arsenal with credible long-range capabilities , it would have an unreliable arsenal with potentially no miniaturized nuclear warheads .
so , like in 1962 , there is a need for a strategic solution .
it may not be true for much longer .
nonetheless , north korea has shown little interest in reform .
now it appears that china is beginning to lose patience .
a second set of options would employ military force , either against a gathering north korean threat or one judged to be imminent .
but all nuclear powers would have to forswear so much as threatening to use nuclear weapons on the korean peninsula .
the united states first tried to resolve the issue back in 1994 , with the us-north korean agreed framework ; but that effort gradually collapsed , owing to actions taken – and not taken – on both sides .
kim kyong-hui has returned to the methods of her father , the dynasty ’ s founder , kim il-sung , who viewed party control as the most convenient and reliable means of exercising power .
the constitution ’ s writers were undoubtedly aware that jews had long been persecuted in other countries , but they concluded that it was not norway ’ s problem .
when corruption hurts partners with that level of clout , it hurts you , too .
since china ’ s multilateral surplus is the economic issue and many countries are concerned about it , the us should seek a multilateral , rules-based solution .
for example , in july , the international monetary fund commendably announced a substantial increase in concessional lending to least-developed countries .
the writer james baldwin put the case for “ progressive ” patriotism well : he loved america more than any country in the world , and for that reason insisted on the right to criticize her perpetually .
first , the middle east turmoil could affect global markets if one or more terrorist attack were to occur in europe or the us – a plausible development , given that several hundred islamic state jihadists are reported to have european or us passports .
moreover , the deep causes of last year ’ s turmoil in emerging markets have not disappeared .
nor does it include asia ’ s geopolitical risks arising from the territorial disputes between china and many of its neighbors , including japan , the philippines , south korea , and vietnam .
russia ’ s lack of reform and adverse demographic trends imply low potential growth and insufficient financial resources to create the fiscal and transfer union that is needed to bring other countries in .
the fed ’ s exit from qe will be slow , keeping interest rates low .
similarly , the risk of deflation worldwide has been contained via exotic and unconventional monetary policies : near-zero interest rates , quantitative easing , credit easing , and forward guidance .
but this year is different .
as saunders and his colleagues observe in their journal article , “ this was the case in the uk in 1700 , is the case in the undeveloped world not on grid electricity in modern times , and is the case for the developed world in modern times using the most advanced lighting technologies . ”
as my colleagues and i put it in our book-length report nuclear weapons : the state of play 2015 , launched in geneva , vienna , and washington in march : “ on the evidence of the size of their weapons arsenals , fissile material stocks , force modernization plans , stated doctrine and known deployment practices , all nine nuclear-armed states foresee indefinite retention of nuclear weapons and a continuing role for them in their security policies . ”
to that end , it is vital that neither country modernizes its nuclear arsenal in a way that is seen as expanding its nuclear capabilities .
the problem is that fusion involves joining two positively charged nuclei – and , as basic science shows , same-sign charges repel each other .
and china ’ s approach toward north korea seems to be changing , spurred by the nuclear issue .
if india��s demand is acceptable , why should other technologically advanced npt signatories , such as brazil , egypt , saudi arabia , and japan – to say nothing of less responsible nations – continue to restrain themselves ?
and , by doing so , it has cemented its status as a rogue state .
rather , it is that our most deadly weapons could be compromised in an instant .
the united nations has declared 2016-2025 the “ decade of action on nutrition , ” and the un ’ s sustainable development goals encourage comprehensive strategies for improving health , eliminating hunger , and promoting sustainable agriculture .
the elections earlier this year , which many at first assumed were a sham , now appear to have produced changes to which asia ’ s countries will need to collectively and individually respond .
if we are to get our policies right , it is crucial that we get our facts right .
president-elect obama has shown pragmatism and realism , and seems to understand that accepting limitations is not weakness ; refusal to acknowledge reality is .
voters concluded that even his own party no longer supported him , and his popularity fell further .
if european sensitivities must be assuaged , greece ’ s debt repayment could be drawn out over 100 years .
in syria , a central element of such an approach would have been engagement with assad .
given the kim regime ’ s past negotiating tactics , obama is understandably reluctant to launch any new diplomatic initiative and may well believe that negotiating with north korea would provide his domestic political opponents with ammunition to ruin his iran deal .
actually , he has not handled them very much , at least not in public .
in this sense , congressional intransigence may have undermined america ’ s position in its competition with china for global power and influence .
in truth , his visit to africa is a reward to his stalwart african-american supporters , who voted overwhelmingly for him in the november election and who remain one pillar of his base .
of course , even leaders who are more like obama than trump struggle to apprise themselves of everything that is going on .
obama ’ s visit to india can help to realize that relationship ’ s potential .
the same middle-of-the-road approach can be taken in the second year to address the still-outstanding fiscal issues .
moreover , it was under truman that the first great step in america ’ s civil-rights revolution , the desegregation of the army , took place .
he would likely accomplish far more if , instead , he offered an explicit promise that the us would come to the gcc countries ’ defense against external aggression in all its forms .
but , come election day , many ( if not most ) americans are likely to ignore recent history and vote against the incumbent .
second , obama did not seriously seek to resolve existing us-china economic disagreements , particularly over trade .
but obama might soon realize that most of his predecessors started as believers in international cooperation , until events forced them to fall back on a strategy of confrontation .
pandering to israel ’ s uncompromising policies may be the easiest way for america ’ s democratic president to avoid trouble in an election year .
he has registered the us congress ’ s hostility toward iran and the desire to confront the islamic republic militarily .
the new strategic arms-reduction treaty , which is still a work in progress , and the ctbt have already aroused skepticism from opposition legislators and opinion-makers .
a man without a plan
obama managed two other major achievements before republican obstructionism took hold : the dodd-frank financial reform bill and the affordable care act ( aca , also known as “ obamacare ” ) .
obama ’ s proposals to boost job creation are convincing , whereas romney ’ s proposals would have little or no effect – and some could even make matters worse .
and , given similar per capita income levels and cultural orientations , overlaps in production and consumption are considerable .
applied appropriately and with a healthy dose of common sense , economics would have prepared us for the financial crisis and pointed us in the right direction to fix what caused it .

cyber security is regarded as complicated and costly ; but cyber offense is seen as inexpensive and sexy .
mindless subsidies that we can not afford will not create a green economy ; what will is investment in research and development to bring down costs , so that green energy eventually can outcompete gas .
but it is costly in terms of both money and energy : a coal-fired power station that adopts ccs must burn even more coal in order to produce the same amount of energy .
after the explosions at deepwater horizon and ixtoc , oil and gas under high pressure entered the water at the seabed .
as a first step , the gcc states are moving toward new tax regimes in early 2018 , including a value-added tax , a corporation tax , property taxes , and taxes on fuel , tobacco , and alcohol .

any economics textbook would recommend exactly this outcome .
a decline in oil prices is to some extent a zero-sum game , with producers losing and consumers gaining .

while household-sector debt was pruned to 115 % of disposable personal income in early 2011 from the peak of 130 % hit in 2007 , it remains well in excess of the 75 % average of the 1970-2000 period .

shahid khaqan abbasi – a well-educated former petroleum minister , who is regarded as a skillful manager – is now serving as interim prime minister . that could mean that he will serve for 45 days – long enough to elect shahbaz sharif , nawaz sharif ’ s younger brother , as pakistan ’ s next leader .

every country ’ s emissions must peak , decline , and eventually reach zero .
clarity of analysis is what we now need the most .
a drought in syria understandably makes news .
for example , it makes little sense that airlines – which actually serve just 7 % of the global population – are exempt from paying fuel taxes , especially at a time when ticket prices are at an historic low .
but the best way to address these fairness concerns is through the agreed emissions targets .
as we reflect on that success , one thing is abundantly clear : the need for ambitious coalitions has returned .

samuelson was a convinced keynesian , though in a limited sense .

a pew research opinion poll conducted between november 30 and december 5 , after the election had cast the usual victor ’ s glow on donald trump , indicated that only 37 % of americans thought trump was well-qualified for the presidency , just 31 % deemed him moral , and a mere 26 % viewed him as a good role model .
yet the deal will cost taxpayers $ 7 million , and still allow carrier to outsource 1,300 jobs to mexico .
for example , trump can not fulfill his campaign promise immediately to trash the paris climate agreement – an international deal that all signatories are legally bound to respect for at least four years .
madrid – the annus horribilis of 2016 is behind us now .
by contrast , trump advocates lower taxes for the wealthy , and seems willing to embrace some form of state capitalism – if not crony capitalism – via protectionist policies and special incentives for companies to manufacture in the us .
sowing doubt about the deal ’ s importance or the scientific evidence backing it up would be a ruinous error .
when nixon adopted his own “ mad ” persona , he was in some ways drawing on the example of nikita khrushchev , my grandfather and nixon ’ s adversary during his tenure as us vice president .
he abandoned the 12-country trans-pacific partnership ( tpp ) , and withdrew the united states from negotiations over the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( ttip ) with the eu , which would have created a vast north atlantic common market .
every un member state signed the paris climate agreement in 2015 .
selling trump ’ s signature issue – protectionism – to the house republicans was not easy .
of course , trump may be able to change the fed board ’ s composition over time , by appointing new governors when stanley fischer , lael brainard , daniel k. tarullo , and jerome h. powell ’ s terms end .
anything written about the trump administration ’ s personnel and policies may be invalid before it is published .
senior officials at the bank of england , for example , have been commendably forthright about this – including at public srac meetings .
here in california , some are hysterically calling for the entire state to become an immigration sanctuary ; there is even talk of secession .
they ’ re not : if trade negotiators don ’ t like their chinese counterparts ’ tone , they can ’ t simply go looking for a more reasonable or more eager partner who can open up china ’ s markets for us farmers .
all that is needed for a politics of institutionalized violence is for such people to be given official license to unleash their most brutal impulses .
all told , the us has alienated some of its closest allies , weakened the nato alliance , and become a bigoted and xenophobic presence on the world stage .
but what would come next ?
what kind of a realist would not use a united western alliance to limit a russia that is trying to engineer a return to cold war spheres of influence ?
while many consumers in developed countries proclaim support for sustainability , they are generally not willing to pay for it or inconvenience themselves .
but liberal democracy has outlasted its rivals in the past , and it will likely do so again .
the undervaluation of the euro , by contrast , has two root causes .
but germany and china are profoundly different , and there is no consensus on whether either country can or will fill america ’ s shoes .
his administration is now threatening to apply extraterritorial sanctions to stop other countries from making “ significant ” defense deals with russia , a leading arms exporter .
but china does not always live by what it preaches as far as cooperation is concerned , as its unilateralism in the south china sea indicates .
the clear purpose of the payoffs was to keep the public from finding out about these affairs before the election .
i am an adviser to a group at mit that created a website , http : //fiftynifty.org , designed to make it easy for americans to use their social network to mobilize calls to congress .
when it comes to trade , china of course immediately retaliated with its own tariffs on $ 50 billion of us imports , just as canada , the european union , and mexico are retaliating for us tariffs on steel and aluminum imports .
however , while china ’ s trade surplus with the us rapidly increased , the contribution of the east asian region to the us trade deficit declined .
in the future , those who remained on the right side of it will be glad they did .
moon , who was elected to boost jobs and curb corruption , campaigned on sweeping away his predecessor ’ s policies , including her hardline approach toward north korea .
don ’ t cry for corporate america
as far as i can figure out , the argument is that trump will magically make the trade deficit go away , and this , in turn , will miraculously boost jobs .
the known unknowns of us sanctions against iran
but the blame does not rest with the jcpoa , which was negotiated as a delimited non-proliferation agreement .
this , together with a pledge to maintain welfare entitlements , amounts to a modern form of keynesian fiscal policy ( though of course not identified as such ) .
more important , american isolationism – based on a false belief that the us was safely protected by two oceans – allowed nazi germany and imperial japan to wage aggressive war and threaten the entire world .
in the israel-palestine conflict , the historical narratives are overwhelming , and the geography is small , so details can not be glossed over .
the incendiary rhetoric of palestine ’ s supporters in the arab world has never done much for the palestinian people , either .
after the fighting was over , israel controlled all of the west bank , gaza , and jerusalem , in addition to the sinai peninsula and the golan heights .
if the us appears to be seeking regime change or a preemptive war , a panicked kim will be more likely to lash out .
all told , north korea ’ s “ opening ” will most likely amount to much less than meets the eye .
at that time , china – pointing to its own experience with the us – proposed that the us and north korea each open a diplomatic office in the other ’ s capital .
but there could be a less unflattering , though equally depressing , explanation .
things are not much better on the economic-policy front .
of course , sentiment can go in both directions .
in france , the far-right national front ’ s marine le pen will attempt to turn the upcoming presidential election into another anti-establishment upset .
in any case , trump seems to have no interest in bringing in experts .
he likens trade deficits to economic losses – almost to theft – and declares china the enemy .
but none of this is supported by the evidence . even nafta skeptics have concluded that its negative effects on net us manufacturing employment have been small to non-existent .
the electoral process is essentially a zero-sum game for the participants .
but tillerson has distanced himself from trump , and rumors are circulating in washington that he already wants out .
much of that disruption has come from america ’ s free-trade relationship with china , a very large country which has a far lower per capita income .
trump failed to heed that historical lesson , which suggests that , like bush , he doesn ’ t know what the mission is .
this week , house speaker paul ryan , heretofore a trump loyalist who had let some of his republican flock take unprecedented actions to undermine mueller ’ s probe , sent tremors through washington when he let it be known that he thought it unwise for a president to pardon himself .
russian president vladimir putin ’ s kleptocratic regime has sent troops into one former soviet republic , georgia ; invaded and occupied part of a second , ukraine ; and harassed and tried to intimidate three others – estonia , latvia , and lithuania ( all three of them nato members ) .
doing so will require patience , which is not trump ’ s strong suit .
at that point , iran would feel free to redeploy its proxies against israel , starting with hezbollah in neighboring lebanon .
is walking away from the iran nuclear deal , as many supporters of the new us administration are demanding , conducive to easing the crisis in the middle east ?
the master of the kremlin is sure to have taken note of this .
for starters , the us must maintain strong ties with its two regional allies – japan and south korea .
but more steps are needed .
under the agreed deal , all participating countries are free to determine their own emissions-reduction targets and the policies for achieving them , and they may make revisions as they see fit .
still , trump can not take all of america with him .
among the middle three quintiles , the effective rate in 2013 was 13.8 % , down from an average of 16.6 % over the three previous decades .
eliminating federal subsidies for health-insurance coverage under the affordable care act ( “ obamacare ” ) would save the government a little over $ 100 billion a year , about 3 % of federal spending .
the trade war is a ham-fisted and nearly incoherent attempt by the trump administration to stall china ’ s economic ascent by trying to stifle the country ’ s exports and access to western technology .
donald trump ’ s dark art of the tweet
the passage giving his controversial speech its name alluded to inner city riots in the united states and invoked virgil : “ like the roman , i seem to see ‘ the river tiber foaming with much blood . ’ ”
the koch brothers , with a combined net worth of some $ 100 billion , have spent freely for decades to take over the us political system , mobilizing other right-wing corporate interests as well .
diffidence and arrogance is a fatal combination for a secretary of state , yet that is precisely what tillerson displayed – and he rarely seemed to have a good day in the job .
the cut in corporate taxes that the republicans are likely to support will not boost wages significantly .
and proposals for a border adjustment tax have been all but forgotten .
and many are expecting a major downturn in the next five years ; otherwise , the economy would have experienced an almost unheard-of decade-and-a-half expansion .
adding to the turmoil was the publication of bob woodward ’ s latest book , fear , which ( like previous books on trump , but to a greater extent and with more depth ) offers a devastating portrait of a dysfunctional white house .
apparently , he thinks that trade surpluses and deficits amount to profit and loss statements for countries .
another major difference today is that many firms are a part of global value chains , whereby goods are assembled in countries like mexico or china from imported components , the most sophisticated of which often come from the us .
at a rally in august , trump reiterated threats about imposing a 25 % tariff on automobiles – particularly those from the european union .
in helsinki , putin confirmed that he had wanted trump to win the election – a calculated move , no doubt , that he knew would seem to corroborate accusations that trump ’ s presidential campaign colluded with the kremlin .
how could such a keen observer of the us , whose former career as a spy honed his ability to decipher people ’ s motives and intentions , fail to recognize the falseness of trump ’ s promises ?
in the early hours of september 2 , 2015 , in bodrum , turkey , a syrian kurdish family boarded a dinghy to try to reach greece .

in 1847 , hungarian obstetrician ignaz semmelweis demonstrated that he could greatly reduce maternal deaths in his clinic simply by having doctors sterilize their hands .

the dossier by former british spy christopher steele about us president donald trump ’ s activities in moscow some years ago may turn out to be as credible as the claims that saddam hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction – or it may not . we simply don ’ t know .
political paths that seemed parallel just a few months ago are now diverging .
political stability may be more surely gained by europe ’ s recommitment to its social-democratic economic model .
it is far too soon to say what , exactly , trump ’ s presidency will mean for asia .
it is certainly not just in america that people desire a sense of vocational accomplishment , rather than simply money to live on .
the truth is that , thanks to extensive experience designing and implementing cost-effective aid programs , poorly used funds represent a tiny fraction of the total invested in aid .
but russia took that deal out of self-interest , not because of the trump administration ’ s obsequiousness .
while wto adjudication takes time and effort , more often than not the rulings have favored the us .
that challenge is to shape the global economy , including trade , so that it finally respects the planet ’ s natural boundaries .
but if the eu had agreed on a ver , european producers would have received that $ 4 billion from higher sales revenues , and for them this sum would have been a very important shot in the arm , allowing them to invest in higher productivity and more sustainable production .
if the tariffs really are about national security , they must be placed on imports mainly from close allies like canada , mexico , japan , and the eu .
if bannon wants to transform the american political landscape , an impeached or defeated trump could become an ideal martyr for his movement .
he is of the world of stagecraft more than statecraft , of pageantry more than policy .
and these change , not just with time , but according to who speaks , when , and where .
but trump now knows what to do to be admired as a great leader .
and the eu ’ s house is fragile : it already taxes car imports from the us at 10 % , compared to the 2.5 % tariff the us has in place for car imports from the eu .
now , he has ordered steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum ( 25 % and 10 % , respectively ) , basing the move on a rarely used national-security exception to world trade organization rules .
meanwhile , the eu and asian steel-importing countries , like india and indonesia , are preparing to adopt safeguard measures to counter a potential surge of imported steel diverted from the us .
nearly four decades after reagan ’ s alleged supply-side revolution , déjà vu is in the air . it ’ s the scent of an approaching storm .
in his 1931 macmillan report to the british parliament , keynes proposed that an import tariff be paired with an export subsidy , which would mimic the effects of exchange-rate devaluation , while maintaining the gold-pound parity .
yet we can not take it for granted .
under president donald trump ’ s administration , the american government does not even bother to pay lip service to democracy anymore .
and we must fight to uphold the nuclear deal with iran and nuclear non-proliferation around the world .
the consequences of trump ’ s trade strategy aren ’ t confined to asia .
and with the yields on government bonds also very low , investors ’ animal spirits were running high , boosting the price of many risky assets .
for better or for worse , the globalization train has long since left the station , and the idea that one can turn it back is utterly naive .
with trump , those good times may be about to come to an end .
and his brazen willingness to challenge the 40-year-old “ one china ” policy by speaking directly with taiwanese president tsai ing-wen – to say nothing of his subsequent anti-china tweets – leaves little doubt that his administration will follow navarro ’ s prescription and take dead aim at america ’ s largest and most powerful trading partner .
depending on the discipline , anywhere from 24 % to 80 % of scientists and engineers employed in the us are foreign-born .
if trump cuts taxes and manages to enact a massive infrastructure program , america ’ s budget deficits will rise , perhaps dramatically .
the mistake is to slash the overall budget , rather than reallocate funds and increase outlays on vitally needed programs that fight hunger and disease , educate children , and prevent conflicts .
europeans should not have to compromise their genuinely held concerns about privacy just to promote trade , which is simply a means ( sometimes ) to achieving higher living standards .
similarly , the united kingdom has just added £7 million ( $ 9 million ) , bringing its total contribution for the current year to £45.5 million .
since being inaugurated before a phantom crowd of millions , trump has picked fights with one government after another , including allies like australia and germany .
but it is also another area where obama set the bar high during his two terms .
vienna – barack obama was right to say that democracy itself was on the ballot in the just-concluded us presidential election .
trump likes headlines and most likely he would prefer a favorable news cycle or two , given the recent gyrations in financial markets .
yet the us – and only the us – now rejects the security council ’ s role in such matters .
this must be the premise of any effort to establish the truth about what happened .
our lives no longer feel ground under them .
clearly , the industrial jobs that are missing in the us have also gone missing in japan and germany , and those jobs are not in mexico .
i claimed in the book that , in the absence of a more concerted government response , too much globalization would deepen societal cleavages , exacerbate distributional problems , and undermine domestic social bargains – arguments that have become conventional wisdom since .
thus , to the very limited extent that tariffs do prove “ punitive ” for china , the effect on other emerging markets and the global economy will not be damaging “ contagion ” but a modest boost to demand that results from displacing chinese exports to the us .
with trump scheduled to meet chinese president xi jinping at the g20 summit in argentina this week , the us may have one last chance to turn things around .
when the us deployed its terminal high altitude area defense system in south korea , china used its economic leverage to retaliate against south korea , but not against america .
as soon as a few experts are found to have been offering half-truths – or worse – the credibility of the entire field can be called into question .

no matter how much their directors may want to focus on the diseases that kill the most people , the current system of financial incentives means that if they did so , their shareholders would remove them , or their companies would soon be out of business . that would help no one .
and , unlike the us , middle eastern countries and their neighbors can not decide to “ pivot ” away from the region when the consequences of their poorly designed interventions become too unruly .
in european-turkish relations , two trains are racing headlong towards each other .
for many politicians , particularly in america , there is an unwillingness to upset turkey without strong justification , given its record as a loyal nato ally and putative eu candidate country .
tensions rise , often accompanied by violence on the streets .
at its peak , during the week of august 8-15 , the currencies of argentina , south africa , and turkey depreciated by 8-14 % against the us dollar .
my father-in-law was the alleged mastermind of the sledgehammer plot , so my wife and i found ourselves moonlighting as forensic detectives and political activists .
but the turkish government also hopes to prevent the establishment of an independent kurdistan that could project its influence into southeast turkey .
this influence does not imply a hegemonic relationship , but rather points to an alternative path for reform and economic development that other primarily muslim countries might take .
turkish democracy ’ s secret weapon
during this period , turkey would face severe political , economic , and security pressures not only from the us and other nato states , but also from russia , iran , and others .
though careful not to challenge the constitution openly , from 1971 to 2001 , they were successively banned as threats to secularism .
all told , the campaign and vote fell far short of established international standards , as election monitors from the organization for security and cooperation in europe have pointed out .
in their view , turkey had re-oriented its foreign policy toward the muslim middle east and away from the west – a shift supposedly reflected in the country ’ s deteriorating relations with israel and improving ties with iran and syria .
given that the government can change laws , name judges , and staff the state administration , turkey ’ s slide to another political model could reach a point of no return .
those who wish to express a kurdish identity , as well as all other citizens , must be confident that , while all remain committed to national unity , turkey is a country in which diversity can thrive .
but this assumes that europe is willing and able to benefit from what turkey has to offer .
unfortunately , the international community as a whole has so far performed poorly in providing an effective response to the crisis .
the headscarf that gül ’ s wife wears for religious reasons was seen as an assault on turkey ’ s sacrosanct principle of secularism .
according to the syrian observatory for human rights , at least 70 civilians – and 21 children – have been killed during the operation , while more than 100 sdf soldiers have perished , including one female soldier whose body was mutilated by turkish forces .
as an emerging power , turkey will continue to realize its own potential and simultaneously contribute to global peace .
there is one thing , however , that could revive the eu , give it much enhanced global respectability , and make it an “ interesting ” place , as well as ensure a return to the international limelight : turkey ’ s admission as a full member .
soon , the us was providing weapons and training to the pyd ’ s armed wing .
indeed , it is one reason why saudi arabia maintains an equal distance from all iraqi factions , and why we are the only country not to have sent a permanent ambassador .
so the best the world can currently hope for is revived dialogue , an agreement to freeze the north ’ s yongbyon nuclear plant , and perhaps a moratorium on further missile and nuclear tests .
unfortunately , the problem of nuclear arms is still very serious today .
although entering peace talks with a future modi government would risk provoking a domestic backlash , sharif might still be willing to break the ice if the main political parties support his moves .

as a perpetual overdraft drawn from the bundesbank , this money was not unlike the international monetary fund ’ s special drawing rights , except that there is much more of it – a sum greater than all of the funds imf countries are willing to loan to one another .
europeans ( germans in particular ) , on the other hand , enjoyed the `` rhineland model '' : a market economy that harnesses economic success to the cause of social justice .
meanwhile , president xi jinping ’ s anti-corruption campaign increasingly looks like a strategy to consolidate power , rather than an effort to reform china ’ s state for the benefit of its economy and society .
the decisive political maneuver – building a coalition with allies of communists – was carried out by lech wałęsa .
the taxpayer is not called upon , even in extreme cases , and states can go bankrupt .
employers ’ associations join with strong trade unions to organize and run training schemes at the sectoral level .
since the end of the cold war , the us has been involved in seven wars and military interventions , and in 2006 , after the invasion of iraq , george w. bush issued a national security strategy that was almost the opposite of trump ’ s , promoting freedom and a global community of democracies .
in a country that has spent the past five decades building an economy from a standing start , the government in which i serve knows only too well that such figures , while showing that our development is progressing , do not tell the whole story – or anything like it .
uber and other digital platforms are redefining the interaction among consumers , workers , and employers .
this educational paradise is not in a rich country with unlimited resources ; it is in a refugee camp in western uganda .
even korea and japan maintain massive duties on imported rice simply to protect the livelihoods of their own rice farmers .
the country will soon become not just a lesser exporter , but also a lesser power .

such an alliance would make yushchenko 's rule , if he wins , more difficult - and he knows it .
for our movement is a triumph , not of mobs but of joyous crowds ; of protests , not of looting ; of clear purpose , not confusion .
when spending is high , it is usually social spending that is badly targeted , which means that only a small share of poor people really benefit .
indeed , this did happen with the one property recovery that my government was able to secure , the giant kryvorizhstal steel works that our former president ’ s son-in-law gained through a rigged sale at a bargain price .
a yanukovych restoration would be a disaster for ukraine , for russia , and for europe , because it would put ukraine ’ s independence in question and tempt russia with dreams of renewed empire .
western sanctions against russia have certainly highlighted the seriousness with which the eu and the united states view putin ’ s efforts to challenge and undermine the core principles of european security and international law .
similarly , the potential for union-led bargaining to redistribute income presupposes non-competitive corporate practices , which in turn generate abnormal profits that can be bargained away by unions .
how convincing is that answer today ?
but may ’ s problematic approach to immigration extends back further .
in other words , the un ’ s foundations , laid down in 1945 , remain strong .
this experimental approach by central banks has involved the conscious decoupling of financial-asset prices from their fundamentals .
add to that the smart use of state resources , together with sure-footed reforms , and china should be able to achieve moderate yet sustainable long-term growth .

and , because few features of the corporate tax law can be changed to reduce that revenue loss , i think the corporate tax rate will be reduced to about 25 % . that would still be substantially less than the current rate and in line with the oecd average .
first , the eu should take a leading role in maximizing the efficiency of each member state ’ s navy , by creating mechanisms that would facilitate the exchange of information between governments , maritime agencies , and navies .

even as china defied world trade rules , forced companies to share their intellectual property , and flexed its military muscles , the us held onto the naive hope that , as china became increasingly prosperous , it would naturally pursue economic and even political liberalization .
today , china sells $ 4 worth of goods to the us for every $ 1 in imports .
this does not bode well for the world ’ s capacity to confront shared challenges , from migration to climate change .

what they fail to acknowledge is that there is also plenty they can do to make the global trading system – and their relationships with china – fairer and more efficient .
today , with the economy normalizing , the case for creative policies like qe , which effectively shortens government debt by sucking long-term bonds out of the market , seems much weaker .
emerging markets have long been particularly vulnerable to this phenomenon .

good regulation means more than just preventing the banking sector from harming the rest of us ( though the fed didn ’ t do a very good job of that before the crisis ) . it also means adopting and enforcing rules that restrict the flow of funds into speculation and encourage the financial sector to play the constructive role in our economy that it should , by providing capital to establish new firms and enable successful companies to expand .
