china is the largest foreign holder of us treasury securities , a major trade partner for the us , europe , latin america , and australia , and a key facilitator of intra-asian trade , owing partly to the scale of its processing trade .

america ’ s perpetual war-making in the middle east shows the worst .
as a result , there are simply too many luxurious condominiums , magnificent government office buildings , and soaring skyscrapers .
but this does not mean that accountability will be lost .
that said , as china undergoes structural economic transition , the stabilization potential of macroeconomic policy is limited .
efforts to address these structural challenges are being frustrated not just by institutional barriers , but also by entrenched official corruption .
in that case , the country will continue to be the world ’ s primary economic engine , contributing about 30 % of global growth until at least 2020 .
policies to improve the environment are also high on the government ’ s agenda for the next five years .
the underlying structural changes that have occurred in china in recent years reinforce this optimism .

moreover , unlike the bank-funded initiatives of 3-4 years ago , which led to a worrisome overhang of local-government debt , the central government seems likely to play a much greater role in financing the current round of projects .

some developing economies are regretting their decision to accept chinese loans .
in the us , a major infrastructure upgrade is long overdue , with politics , among other factors , impeding progress .

a century ago , china was driven to support wilson , and then to loathe him , by its own weakness .
now , china needs institutionalized mechanisms for enforcing the rule of law – one aspect of western political systems that xi admires – among cpc officials , though the idea that the judiciary could be independent of the party remains farfetched .
china ’ s national bureau of statistics ( nbs ) revealed last week that ten of the 70 large and medium-size chinese cities surveyed had recorded annual price increases of more than 20 % for newly built commercial housing . in the first-tier cities of shanghai and shenzhen , those gains were even higher : above 37 % .

more precisely , confusion about that policy has been roiling the markets .
yet , in contrast to the last round of renminbi depreciation , investors aren ’ t panicking .
but even the current regime is becoming difficult to manage .
one reason for the renminbi ’ s continued weakness in international finance is that , despite considerable progress since 2010 , it remains a half-baked international currency .
so when president xi jinping launched his “ new silk road ” initiative in 2013 , no one should have been surprised by the historical reference .
these new worries are raising alarm bells in china .
viewed in this context , the belief that the government ’ s approach to linyi reflects a new responsiveness to human-rights abuses seems naïve .
tokyo – as libya ’ s national transitional council attempts to establish a functioning government for a newly liberated country , the truth about what went on under col. muammar el-qaddafi ’ s regime is starting to come to light .
treatment is extremely limited where it is available .
such diplomatic realism need not lead to zero-sum outcomes , as the example of european integration demonstrates .
missile tests , pla military exercises and threatening rhetoric have been sufficient deterrents until now .
perhaps the speculative-inflow scenario will play out , but in slow motion .
instead of focusing on securing a soft landing today , chinese policymakers should be worrying about the brick wall that economic growth may hit in the second half of the quinquennium .

in recent years , research has indicated that vested interests and powerful lobbies distort economic policies and cause governments to miss good opportunities .
ironically , today ’ s pain stems from one of the great successes that emerging economies have achieved : the reduction of foreign-currency funding in favor of local-currency debt .
ultimately , even hurricane katrina and other disasters of similar magnitude are small by world standards .
the ip standards advanced countries favor typically are designed not to maximize innovation and scientific progress , but to maximize the profits of big pharmaceutical companies and others able to sway trade negotiations .
other reforms concern the patents themselves , and include shortening patent terms , introducing use-it-or lose-it provisions , and instituting stricter criteria that limit patents to truly meaningful inventions .
the trip ’ s scheme failed to recognize this .
google and alibaba now compete for the world ’ s top computer engineers , many of whom are european , in order to win the race to control the world ’ s data , develop quantum computing ( on which the next generation of encryption will rely ) , to create more profitable applications of artificial intelligence .
a similar court should do the same for crimes against the environment and its defenders .

his reply was always conditional .
still , the fight is far from over .
time , like money , is a scarce resource ; and , because goods and services related to information require our attention , they are time-intensive .
many governments have recognized this to some extent , setting ambitious goals for mobile internet coverage , broadband infrastructure , and public wi-fi access .

most rational analysts would argue that keeping the planet healthy enough to support a thriving economy in the long term is a good investment .
if each garment were replaced half as often , the industry ’ s total greenhouse-gas emissions would plummet by 44 % .
iran , after all , is not building an islamic bomb .
iran certainly regarded the meeting as a propaganda opportunity , promising wide media coverage at a time when it was in the eye of a diplomatic hurricane .
that year , he used diplomacy relentlessly and skillfully to achieve a breakthrough nuclear agreement with the soviet union , the limited test ban treaty .
it is in this labyrinth of power that rouhani is fighting an intense battle with his conservative adversaries – a battle that may be far from over .
and yet these outcomes do not necessarily amount to broken promises .
indeed , the two other options – iran ’ s emergence as a nuclear power or the use of military force to prevent this – would , in addition to all of its horrible consequences , also increase oil and gas prices .
but the agreement ’ s potential benefits can not be denied .
today ’ s low- and middle-income countries are only now entering a period of true sovereignty .

but the so-called joint comprehensive plan of action will be judged by its implementation , which will take years .
the consensus among the negotiating partners – one of the few points of agreement regarding the middle east among the security council ’ s permanent membership – was crucial in convincing iran to take the negotiations seriously .
but if iran ’ s hardliners were frustrated by previous negotiations , their disappointment vanished yesterday .
the result is the emergence of the islamic state , carrying with it the threat of extermination of the country ’ s minorities , including christians and alawites .
sanctions , while useful , work only in the very long term , and a change in the balance of power within the country is not foreseeable in the short term .
iran ’ s security forces are too strong and have too much at stake in the current system , which gives them control of vast swaths of the iranian economy .
india ’ s stance must be particularly troubling for trump .
in his speech at a gathering of sunni muslim leaders in riyadh , trump delivered a sharp and visceral rebuke of all things iranian – including , it seems , that country ’ s recent elections .
it is thus unfathomable that they would dictate to arab countries in any capacity .
but the same can be said of jewish and christian texts ; and the right to education , without discrimination , is guaranteed in several international declarations and covenants , such as the universal declaration of human rights , to which almost all countries , including iran , have agreed .
most worrisome of all , he is close to the two main groups that represent the most extreme elements in iran : the islamic revolutionary guard corps and the basij organization .
a disastrous possible policy – military attack on iran – has been headed off by a misguided , misinterpreted intelligence report .
when a national currency loses 50 % of its value in a matter of weeks , economic collapse is at hand .
yet few in the iranian establishment understand that being the leading regional power brings responsibility ; and that only responsible behavior can create legitimacy and acceptance that iran craves .
nor can it exercise its traditional functions in the religious sphere to provide support to civil society in the country .
reacting to mounting fear of western military action against iran ’ s nuclear facilities , revolutionary guard commanders recently sharpened their rhetoric against the us and israel .
what ’ s missing this time , however , is a charismatic leader comparable to khomeini .

it was bad enough to deal with sadr as a bandit ; simple political arithmetic now dictates that he will likely be the central figure deciding the outcome of october ’ s vote on the constitution .
the new shia elites who control iraq have emulated their allies in iran , creating a system that effectively chooses which of their rivals may constitute a “ legitimate ” opposition and which may not participate in the political process .
above all , the government must spare no effort in convincing poor iraqis of the value of democracy and freedom , and how important the constitution is in realizing their aspirations for a better life .
the easiest strategy for liberals is to side with conservative muslims who reject not only radical islamism , but also political reform .
the key to improving police operations is to embed more us and allied police officers in the police force to mentor iraqi officers .
for iraq , this is a brain drain that will be hard to repair .

warwick , uk – is academic freedom affordable in a time of economic crisis ?
· too many sectors of the us economy have not completed their balance-sheet rehabilitation process .
two economists , rudiger fahlenbrach and rene stulz , tested these implications by studying the ceos of almost 100 large financial institutions from 2006 to 2008 .
after all , the us went off the gold standard in 1933 , and the fed cut the discount rate to 1.5 % in 1934 , ending deflation ( except for minor episodes ) ; but the unemployment rate did not fall consistently below 15 % until 1941 and the onset of world war ii .

is gordon brown electable ?
given these factors , the jgb market , which has been stable so far , will face serious trouble in the years ahead .
first , overall demand for goods and services is much weaker , both in europe and the united states , than it was in the go-go years before the recession .
in past decades , large expansions of bank reserves caused lending surges that increased the money supply and fueled inflationary spending growth .
its response was to offer targeted and expedited debt relief – often by bringing in new temporary bankruptcy legislation that forced limited debt write-downs .
against this background , the notion that reclaiming territory from isis will amount to freeing the region of extremist groups is clearly naive .

how does the fed deal with such a situation ?
moreover , israelis and people close to hezbollah in lebanon are talking about “ another round , ” while many pundits in the middle east believe that a limited war could unblock a stagnant political situation .
but their arguments did not carry the day .
that reflects saudi arabia ’ s output increase of more than a million barrels a day , as well as mandated efficiency measures in the european union , partly motivated by efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions , which have contributed to a comparable drop in demand – by about 1.5 % a year .
palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas and his colleagues know perfectly well that un recognition by itself will not deliver an end to occupation and the full realization of a sovereign palestine .
some palestinians in the west bank and gaza objected to the accords ’ failure to call explicitly for the end of illegal israeli settlement building .
there was no public reaction when , after the gatekeepers was released , prime minister binyamin netanyahu ’ s office issued a statement saying he had not seen the documentary and had no intention of doing so .
bds is an “ anti-apartheid ” movement , comes the reply , adopting the methods and spirit of nelson mandela in south africa .
as recently as 2006 , ehud olmert had won an election in israel on a dovish platform , pledging to extend ariel sharon ’ s unilateral withdrawal from gaza to the west bank .
today , israel is relying on historical claims to occupy another people .
those prospects will diminish further if the annexationist jewish home , with whose domestic platform ( a liberal economy , a better deal for the middle classes , and military service for the orthodox ) lapid fully concurs , joins a likud-yesh atid government .
and there may indeed be cases where armed intervention is the only way to stop mass murder .
while the weakening and rollback of iran serves israeli strategic interests , israel will have to reckon with sunni islamist power everywhere in its vicinity , leading directly to a strengthening of hamas .
given that the palestinians ’ political leadership is divided between the fatah-led palestinian authority , which controls the west bank , and hamas , which has established an islamic fundamentalist regime in gaza , a deal between israel and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas would mean little .
this approach also lost credibility as a result of the rise of hamas and its determination to wage permanent war on israel ; iran ’ s expanding influence and nuclear weapons ’ program ; and the high – even rising – levels of hatred against israel among arabs and muslims .
israel ’ s lonely prosperity
such was the case of the 1973 war , which was started by president anwar sadat with the aim of forcing the united states to broker an egyptian-israeli peace .
the palestinian leader yasir arafat turned him down flat and instead returned to a massive campaign of terrorism against israel .
and it repeatedly uttered threats that “ all ” options are on the table .
the palestinian police have cooperated with the israelis to contain violence on the west bank .
in some cases , there is explicit cooperation with israel .
once people stop believing that israel is defending the west against fascism , israel will be blamed for all the violence in the middle east .
i have no first-hand knowledge of the legislative process in the united states .
it has impressive universities and a high education level , well- managed global companies , and a strong work ethic .
indeed , the opposition has access only to a few newspapers and radio stations , leaving the internet the sole remaining space of freedom in russia .
the dsm-iii ’ s confusion of normal intense sadness and depressive mental disorder , which persists to the present , emerged inadvertently from psychiatry ’ s response to challenges to the profession during the 1970 ’ s .
consequently , employment and wages have also increased .
this type of rescue strategy also makes it possible to increase the required supervisory equity-asset ratios of banks in the midst of the crisis without risking a credit crunch .
they need not be democracies , either : china , vietnam , and cuba come to mind .
given that china is the second largest economy in the world , it didn ’ t take long for european officials to reduce their own growth projections , and for the international monetary fund to revise downward its expectations for global growth .
some imports would become cheaper as well , benefiting american consumers .
unfortunately , that spirit did not end well , with both stock prices and corporate earnings crashing catastrophically at the end of the decade .
there are three reasons for europe ’ s changing politics .
following last year ’ s bailout , italy ’ s treasury owns about 70 % of the bank .
but italy is not just losing skilled , ambitious , and visionary workers .
why italy is the latest to question policy orthodoxy
and while some of the coalition ’ s popularity is due to support for unattractive policy positions – namely , the ruling parties ’ anti-immigrant stance and confrontation with the eu – it also reflects voters ’ desire for a modernized welfare state .
china , for its part , is rapidly advancing in these areas , creating significant opportunities for young people in the process .
the obvious candidates will not or can not take on the role : britain has excluded itself ; france is paralyzed until next year ’ s presidential election and possibly beyond ; and spain can not even form a government .
renzi , too , pursued limited reforms , but eventually fell prey to his own outsize ego .
bowing to this reality , the coalition partners have now dropped the idea of abandoning the euro , expunging the possibility from their “ contract ” and respective websites .
this sclerotic arrangement , however , has enabled those same right-wing populists to present themselves as the only alternative to “ the system . ”
at a time of substantial economic challenges – italy ’ s output has been stagnant for a decade , and its public finances remain precarious – the populist five star movement , which has pledged to hold a referendum on continued euro membership , may well tempt voters .
they are underwriting the narrative that renzi is the only person who can save italy from itself ; that may be the right bet – at least for the time being .
for example , tax evasion is pervasive , so increases disproportionately hit those who already pay , fueling a widespread perception of unfairness .
as if this was not enough , prodi will face another problem .
and those are just the official figures ; the actual numbers are probably much higher , possibly more than double .
russia envisions ukraine becoming something akin to bosnia – a radically federalized country comprising political units that each adhere to their own economic , cultural , and geopolitical preferences .
these assets are generally not followed by multiple analysts , and are not easily understood , giving him a greater advantage in applying his intellectual skills and the skills of others around him .
one small but important example of this is the average cost of setting up a business , which is €158 ( $ 212 ) in canada , €664 in the us , and €2,285 in the eu ( and as much as €4,141 in italy ) .
for now , such a perspective favors policy gradualism .
in america , the post-world war ii g.i . bill financed higher education for demobilized soldiers , and was a highly beneficial public investment in human capital .
some american strategists advocate a largely technological solution to this dilemma .
in fact , these moves might create new barriers to entry , entrenching market leaders and undermining innovation .
the us was far from consistent or perfect in this process , sometime to murderous effect in places like vietnam .
why ?
marginal parties that are not connected to political violence and do not incite hatred should probably be left in peace – distasteful as their rhetoric may be .
under koizumi ’ s leadership , insolvent banks were made whole again .
markets reacted sharply , with the yen strengthening by 2 % against the dollar and the japanese stock market falling 3 % .
brussels – demography is not destiny , at least not entirely .
in japan , where cognitive , academic scores are overly emphasized above holistic human development , this style of engagement with the arts , including music , can foster not only an appreciation of beauty , but also imagination , cooperation , initiative , leadership , empathy , and compassion .
even if japan took steps to become a “ normal ” country ( whatever that term may imply ) , it would still not equal the power of the us or china .
that is why abe is determined to amend , or at least reinterpret , japan ’ s constitution to allow for the kinds of defense maneuvers that other countries , from israel to india , employ when their people are threatened .
for the 30 years since the beginning of china ’ s economic reforms , chinese industry has achieved impressive efficiency gains by adopting new technologies and realizing economies of scale , leading to a huge expansion in locally made products suitable for export .
of course , the wealth of the government does play a role in economic performance .
such a scheme would include joint military exercises and information-sharing arrangements not just with south korea and the us , but also with china , india , the southeast asian countries .
what central banks can not achieve with traditional tools can now be accomplished through the circuitous channels of wealth effects in asset markets or with the competitive edge gained from currency depreciation .
and it is beefing up its relations with emerging giants like brazil , mexico , nigeria , and turkey .
he is particularly concerned with the constitutional provision that prohibits japan from maintaining “ land , sea , and air forces , ” arguing that it seems to be in direct contradiction with the existence of the country ’ s self-defense forces .
though the hike would have ostensibly served the objective of balancing japan ’ s budget , it also would have undermined consumption , which has yet to recover from the last tax hike , from 5 % to 8 % , implemented in 2014 .
japanese reactions reveal an extraordinary degree of stubborn self-righteousness .
because the dpj has neither an upper-house majority nor the two-thirds lower-house majority needed to override upper-house votes , his government will be unable to pass budget and/or appropriation bills by the end of the current fiscal year , march 31 , 2011 .
indeed , a landslide victory on the scale of abe ’ s may very well lead to some of them completely disappearing from political life .
rather , the japanese behave as they do because they are decent people .
asia ’ s new security landscape places a premium on seamless cooperation among us allies – a prospect that the sustained bickering between south korea and japan calls into question .
the world has been paying greater attention to reducing loss of life from disasters .
japan ’ s 150 million people still produce far more than 2.5 billion chinese and indians .
abe and his ministers were simply not provided with critical facts by the bureaucrats who are supposed to serve them .
for both reasons , a medium-term plan for some fiscal consolidation is desirable .
its style is almost scientific – factual , staccato-like , and unemotional – and it goes a long way toward meeting china ’ s demand for a convincing investigation and act of contrition that might allow the bitter and still poisonous past to be overcome .
this is why i support america ’ s strategic “ rebalancing ” to enhance peace and security in the asia-pacific region .
the election question
even with a significant deepening of ties , however , bilateral relationships alone will be inadequate to counterbalance china .
and they have provided only about $ 250 million in aid over the last decade – a paltry sum , given the potential consequences of afghan instability for china ’ s $ 6 trillion economy .
far from vindicating him , historians will know exactly whom to blame .
indeed , their relationship is now characterized by what the japanese call seirei keinetsu ( cold politics , hot economics ) .
india ’ s relationship with china may depend on this choice for many years to come .
yet european competitiveness is in danger .
and , despite the resistance of saudi arabia and the sunni opposition , the us and the eu currently seem more inclined to accept iran ’ s inclusion in the geneva ii negotiations , especially now that advances are being made in the implementation of the international agreement on iran ’ s nuclear program concluded in november .
ukraine thus could have maintained normal relations with its neighbors , with the eu , and with russia .
for europe , interdependence is strongly correlated with energy security .
alain peyrefitte , the scholar , politician , and confidant of charles de gaulle , said that “ without europe , france will be nothing ” ; but , without france , europe , too , would be nothing .
international negotiations with iran over its nuclear program have provided some reason for optimism , which could lend impetus to efforts in syria .
this endless search for the true locus of responsibility ( both causal and remedial ) is not restricted to the realm of climate change .
and the rest of the world does not seem to know how to stop its unrelenting advance .
emerging-market central-bank governors fear a us that alternates between expansionary policy that fuels huge hot-money inflows and a domestic inflationary spiral , and rapid tightening that chokes off credit and causes a domestic recession .
anyone with a laptop and an internet connection can gossip with ( or about ) virtual friends ; witness extraordinary events that may or may not have happened ; or play games in a mock world of incomparable complexity .
but the depiction of ideas as being somehow “ un-american ” has always been an epithet , not an argument .
put another way , globalization lowered the wages of low-skill advanced-country workers because others would perform their jobs more cheaply , and then consume the value that they had created .
instead , they are “ chosen by private equity firms to run the companies they control .
one thing is clear : economists no longer dare to assume that trend is trend and cycle is cycle , and that their reciprocal interactions are small enough to neglect on the first pass .
france has also undertaken ambitious reforms to reduce job-market dualism and give greater flexibility to employers as well as greater security to employees .
fortunately , the answer is a qualified yes : there are ways to ensure that fiscal accommodation now is followed by consolidation later .
in southern europe , investment has literally collapsed ; even in germany , it will reach pre-crisis levels only this year .
is there a better way ?
it may take time before agreement is reached and decisions are made , but the discussion is bound to resume .
furthermore , some countries have succeeded in reducing their public spending significantly without changing their social model altogether .
on the political front , the discussion is about what the eu should aim to become , and the post-election temptation is to give only one answer : less .
according to a cnn political analyst , it was “ the most important political speech of 2017 – and one of the most powerful political speeches in the modern era of the senate . ”
both scotland and the ruk might agree that scotland would temporarily keep the british pound but would move to a new scottish pound or the euro .
an urban sdg , promoting inclusive , productive , and resilient cities , would greatly empower tens of thousands of cities worldwide to take up the cause of sustainable development for their own citizens , their countries , and the world .
yet there was also frustration and bewilderment , as vocal opponents of foreign aid began to oppose the increased funding for disease control .
cynicism is rife on all sides .
but today ’ s games also create an opportune moment to look back at russia ’ s recent economic history – and to peer forward as well .
i know this from personal experience .
hardline approaches brought expanded conflicts in afghanistan , iraq , libya , and syria , leading to plenty of deaths but not to meaningful political or economic solutions in the affected countries .
there is even a place at the table for exxonmobil , chevron , bp , peabody , koch industries , and other oil and coal giants .
we have entered the age of sustainable development .
the result has been an unmitigated catastrophe : the destruction of iraq as a functioning society in an ongoing civil war , fueled by outside powers , that has caused economic ruin and collapsing living standards .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon has called for political leaders to attend a special summit in september 2014 , 14 months ahead of the paris meeting , to launch intensive negotiations .
by the criteria of international use as a reserve currency among central banks and as a vehicle in foreign-exchange markets , the most rapid declines took place from 1978 to 1991 and from 2001 to 2010 .
but the emerging-market countries have been so disunited that in 2011 they failed to support a common candidate for imf managing director .
indeed , it was ronald reagan ’ s administration that pioneered the use of cap and trade to phase out leaded gasoline in the 1980 ’ s .
even if good leadership means a demonstrated ability to prevail in the face of intransigent domestic political opposition , coup attempts , and invasions , surely no leader can be held responsible for the effects of droughts , floods , or other natural disasters .
if the borrower runs into trouble , cacs make it possible to restructure debt with the agreement of a substantial majority of creditors ( usually around 70 % ) .
jokowi and sisi seem to have adopted this approach .
second , there is the high compensation of corporate executives and people in finance .
but in this case we are talking about an ecb purchase of dollars that would change the euro money supply .
jeremy corbyn , the current favorite to become the next leader of britain ’ s labour party , is the latest victim of this chorus of disparagement .
of course , there is a certain logic to the public ’ s disdain for superstar compensation outside of professional sports and entertainment .
these risks can be managed effectively through proper treatment systems ( as in japan and south korea ) .
is this right ?
as a result , teachers spend their time in the most effective way possible – solving problems with students – instead of delivering undifferentiated lessons .
so , rather than hire in panic at the first sign of a recovery for fear that they will be unable to do so later and lose sales , firms would rather make sure that the recovery is well established before adding workers .
“ [ h ] istory teaches us that enmities between nations , as between individuals , do not last forever , ” he said .
mahmoud al-habbash , the palestinian minister of religious affairs , even went so far as to demand “ assurances that the talks won ’ t fail , ” because if they do , a new intifada would surely erupt .
in the case of johnny hallyday , it is perhaps not too farfetched to believe that this man of sphinx-like mystery is now , like baudelaire , “ a block of granite surrounded by vague fear ” whose “ fierce nature sings only to the rays of the setting sun . ”
brief and less complex interventions were also unsuccessful in ending violent crises – and in some cases even exacerbated them .
gains in south asia and north africa have been modest , while conditions in west asia have actually worsened .
first , the sanctions imposed so far – visa cancellations , asset seizures or freezes , and the like – will not give sevastopol back to ukraine , but they will eventually bite , at least in certain russian business sectors .
ultimately , brazilians may just be too unsure about handing power to silva , who has become a media phenomenon but remains an unknown quantity .
nonetheless , they have shown great restraint in northern iraq since saddam ’ s fall , contenting themselves with building up their autonomous province both economically and politically – to the point that it is independent in all but name , with a strong and experienced army in the peshmerga militia .
if this happens , iraq , lebanon , and jordan would not be left unaffected .
it has largely been germany that has opposed integrating europe ’ s energy and natural gas markets .
this would require securing control over these resources . it would also require establishing new export routes to europe that , by circumventing ukraine , would make the country vulnerable to blackmail , because a cutoff of gas supplies to it would no longer trouble europe .
emerging economies on their own
the bretton woods conference marked one of history ’ s greatest examples of international economic cooperation .
but these simple steps are easy enough to grasp – and within reach for everyone .
in 1999 , in elliot associates , lp v. banco de la nacion and the republic of peru , the second circuit court of appeals determined that the plaintiff ’ s intent in purchasing the discounted debt was to be paid in full or otherwise to sue .
most important , markets have never been very good at achieving structural transformations quickly on their own ; the transition from agriculture to manufacturing , for example , was anything but smooth ; on the contrary , it was accompanied by significant social dislocation and the great depression .
or , to put it another way , while the government is clearly doing some things that it should not , it is also not doing some things that it should .
there have to be rules of the game , and these are established through political processes .
indeed , the agreements have been used to challenge government actions ranging from debt restructuring to affirmative action .
new thinking is a natural consequence of high population density , provided the right conditions are met – conditions that include public spaces in which people can interact and culture can thrive , and a democratic ethos that welcomes and encourages public participation .
new york – there ’ s something dismal about writing year-end roundups in the half-decade since the eruption of the 2008 global financial crisis .
does he realize that since the era of deregulation and liberalization began in the late 1970s , gdp growth has slowed markedly , and that what growth has occurred has primarily benefited those at the top ?
zurich – the world ’ s health needs are changing dramatically .
a decade ago , telecoms infrastructure was almost non-existent .

it is also true that we do not have to buy any particular book or listen to an opera .
many other countries have now identified extremism as their single most important challenge .
immigration did rank at the top , but , as blair noted in his speech , anti-immigration sentiment was mainly against multicultural immigration , which had little or nothing to do with the eu .

too big to jail
but even if this scenario is possible in theory , it is unlikely to occur in practice .
in that possibility lies the well-being of us all .
for a group of people so committed to free markets and so enamored of “ creative destruction , ” that is a question that urgently needs to be addressed .
to be sure , many have suggested that the current crisis represents a vital opportunity to overcome these tensions and build an ever-closer union , citing the belief of jean monnet , one of the european union ’ s main architects , that crises are critical to spur progress toward integration .

allowing existing protectionist trade barriers to remain in place – or worsen – would not only deprive citizens in tpp countries of higher incomes ; it would also deal a damaging blow to international cooperation .
the us sovereign-debt market shows no similar evidence of having reached a limit yet .
what is required is a mechanism against “ social dumping ” that prevents poor labor practices in exporting countries from spilling over to the importing country .
similarly , incomes around the world would rise significantly from liberalizing more global trade in both goods and services .
this is worth bearing in mind , given that the fed ’ s adoption of qe in 2008 ( which it continued to pursue until last year ) had the effect of weakening the dollar from 2009 to 2011 , prompting the same accusations of “ beggar thy neighbor policies ” against the us that congressmen now level against others .

the us remains stuck in the time-worn mindset of a deficit saver with massive multilateral trade deficits and the need to draw freely on global surplus saving to support economic growth .
the scene is thus set for a sino-american showdown , with all of its weighty and unforeseeable geo-strategic implications .
when i have written in favor of freer trade and liberal immigration , i have been denounced as a “ curry nigger . ”
meanwhile , many university graduates – including a whopping 45 % in south korea – are struggling to find jobs .

after world war ii , high inflation in japan undermined confidence in the yen ’ s stability , leading many japanese to barter .
if those pushing for tax cuts stick to their guns and refuse to accept reality , their agenda , if enacted , would result in a significantly wider budget deficit , which would increase the national debt to unprecedentedly high levels .
another is to ensure that companies pay taxes – perhaps by lowering the corporate-tax rate for companies that invest and create jobs in america , and raising it for those that do not .
and then there ’ s the fact that iran , unlike most of its regional adversaries , is a functioning democracy .
given its economic size and favorable geography , structural forces would likely have produced some form of american primacy in the twentieth century .
america and the world in transition
their palaces were not just magnificent architectural structures , but also venues for maintaining social control .
instead , we should look at trump ’ s own analysis of existing agreements in the context of his views on issues such as national security and working-class jobs and incomes .
but a serious problem will arise if trump attempts to use it to protect his family – not a farfetched scenario , given pending fbi investigations into his inner circle ’ s dealings with russia .
they discount the dampening effect of nuclear weapons , which for more than four decades helped keep the cold war between the us and the soviet union from turning hot .
as it stands , it seems that trump is hoping to impress critics with headlines about what are actually small-bore accomplishments .
and so it was – and then some .

one reporter joked that the next press christmas party would be held at the recently opened trump international hotel down the street from the white house , and there would be a cash bar .

the decline of us influence , and the strengthening of china ’ s strategic clout , continues unabated .
and treasury bonds are secure : the federal government has not fallen into arrears on its debt since the disastrous war of 1812 .
in north korea , all of this dictated from the top .
china has a significantly larger population than the us does , so it stands to reason that it will surpass the us in nominal size at some point ( unless it were trapped in a permanent state of poor productivity ) .
but the yale historian donald kagan has shown that athenian power was in fact not growing .
and his team has drafted additional executive orders that will reduce or even terminate funding for international organizations and withdraw the us from multilateral treaties .
and trade and investment between taiwan and mainland china have flourished .
and xi has plenty of policy tools available to ensure that the chinese economy does not suffer any serious damage from us tariffs .
but addressing this issue requires technical expertise and negotiating skill , not blunt threats based on inadequate knowledge .
on the contrary , the paris accord is very good for america , and it is the us that continues to impose an unfair burden on others .
it is too early to say what the trump administration will do when it comes to climate change .
while globalization , and the trade openness that underpins it , has the potential to enrich the entire global economy , so far the richest have captured a hugely disproportionate share of the gains .
ultimately , demand for imports would fall , as would the benefits for consumers and new tax revenues for the government .
since then , the administration has carved out exemptions for certain us allies , while using the tariffs as a bargaining chip to extract concessions from others .
by july , the north was testing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the us , and it is believed that the country already possesses the capability to produce a miniaturized , icbm-ready nuclear payload .

the end result is underperformance of the saver ’ s retirement account .
today , it could undertake similar swaps , but with countries facing large capital outflows , thereby slowing the dollar ’ s appreciation .
with foreign earnings growing and foreign corporate-tax rates falling , deferral has become increasingly attractive .
but the real global fault line is the italian economy , which has not grown for nearly a generation .

but , while business leadership and collective action are needed to create a sustainable and inclusive economy ( a central message of our commission ’ s report ) , the private sector can not do it alone .
a trump presidency will lead to an epic geopolitical shift : for the first time since 1941 , europe can not rely on the us defense umbrella ; it now stands alone .
the french and german governments recently decided to move ahead on a plan jointly to develop a new fighter jet , which is certainly a good first step . but one should not expect to see any spectacular cooperative achievements in the immediate future .
given that the republicans also control both houses of congress – and will soon make many judicial appointments – there is virtually no effective constraint on the executive branch .

but while this assistance has done plenty of good , the attached strings are tying our hands .
the ongoing north korea crisis implies that the us-china relationship during the trump-xi era will be one of intense strategic competition .
the question is whether it can work in the real world .

by and large , the most successful bankers in recent years have been exactly the types of experts trump seems to avoid .
as socrates approaches the court , he runs into his friend euthyphro , a young man who is on his way to the same place to prosecute his own father for the slaying of another man .
and , relative to the likes of trump , putin does not look so bad at all .

none of these responses is constructive .
in recent weeks , israel has clashed with iranian forces in southern syria to show that it will not allow iran to establish a presence there .

that was certainly true after the two iraq wars .
evil has indeed often been the agent of good ( without hitler , no united nations , no pax americana , no european union , no taboo on racism , no decolonization , no keynesian economics , and much else ) .
as defenders of a non-exclusive , rights-based creed , liberals are compelled to meddle in the affairs of other countries whose policies don ’ t accord with liberal values .
needless to say , not everyone is as optimistic as trump .
the simple truth is that saudi arabia can not distance itself from the palestinian cause and allow other countries like turkey and even iran to carry the banner .
of course , that is not how trump ’ s administration presents it .
if the new crown prince is worried about his domestic political standing , he will be reluctant to stand shoulder to shoulder with an american president seen as too close to an israel that is unwilling to satisfy even minimal palestinian requirements for statehood .
and , more to the point , they were successful : their eventual assassination of conrad of montferrat led directly to the political collapse of the crusader coalition and the defeat of richard the lionheart of england .
more to the point , he will explain the logic of why sanctions must be suspended before he can even start to lay the groundwork for denuclearization .
despite these different possible interpretations , the trump administration seized on kim ’ s statements as a sure sign that north korea is ready to disarm .
instead , trump will win praise for “ forcing ” china into a negotiation that it never resisted and averting the risk of a trade war that he himself created .
third , this undesirable policy mix of excessively loose fiscal policy and tight monetary policy will tighten financial conditions , hurting blue-collar workers ’ incomes and employment prospects .
explaining these unexpected responses could provide a glimpse of what the next few months have in store for markets .
he wants to make it even smaller , and to avoid granting fundamental sovereign rights , such as control over land , air , water , and border crossings .
san jose , california – marco polo , the famous thirteenth-century venetian merchant , was one of the first europeans to trade with china .
but let us take at face value , if only for the sake of argument , that the trump administration wants to renegotiate nafta in good faith .
that has made mexico an attractive location for assembling asian-produced content into final manufactured goods for sale in the us or canada .
but trump showed little interest in following up on the attack with diplomacy .
before they became obsessed with iran and the muslim brotherhood , arab leaders often began meetings with us officials by railing against israel .

finance is complex , and a lot of devils could be , and were , hidden in the details .

for its part , nato does have a deeply integrated command structure for the forces that are assigned to it .
the fate of the 12-country trans-pacific partnership trade agreement seems already to have been sealed , with trump assuring the public that he would shelve that deal – concluded but not ratified by the us senate – on his first day in office . this is unfortunate , as the tpp would have revolutionized intellectual property rights and boosted transparency to unprecedented levels , while lowering tariff and non-tariff barriers .
( because deputy attorney general rod rosenstein must make the call to dismiss mueller , and has said that he sees no reason to do so , trump would first have to fire rosenstein , which would look too much like the saturday night massacre , the turning point in nixon ’ s presidency . )
trump may not like it , but he must call out kim ’ s duplicity , especially given the latest intelligence .
as many have pointed out , the terrorism list is by no means a complete compendium of countries whose security services may have been involved with terrorist groups .
to be sure , pakistan could respond to such sanctions by blocking america ’ s overland access to afghanistan , thereby increasing the cost of resupplying us forces by up to 50 % .
and he signed off his tweet announcing that he had made a decision on the paris accord with the words , “ make america great again ! ”
in this sense , are we living in the époque of trump , in which trump ’ s revival of the “ america first ” slogan of the american nazis in the 1930s has encouraged a loosening of bigoted tongues ?
the president ’ s daughter , ivanka trump , is spearheading the effort .
the benefits are diminishing with the rise of the euro and china ’ s renminbi as competing reserve currencies .
democracies require leaders to answer too many questions , jump through too many hoops , and face too much resistance .
martin luther king , jr. benefited from growing up in an african-american church tradition rich in the rhythms of the spoken word .
only in a full-blown crisis can popular opinion effectively determine who becomes leader .
arguments that it was necessary , or even “ optimal , ” to skew financial support from the government toward banks and their executives are not persuasive ( at least , not outside wall street ) .
its leader rails against foreigners , erects various import barriers , and pushes for low interest rates and lots of cheap credit for favored sectors .
more important , who would want it to work ?
and , of course , trump will still claim that the us economy can grow at a rate of 4 % , even though all mainstream economists , including republicans , agree that the potential growth rate will remain around 2 % , regardless of his policies .
responsible journalists report that trump white house aides ( who are notoriously sieve-like ) say the us president feels alone and cornered .
we should ignore his impetuous accusations and relentless contradictions .
